<h2>Preface</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE stories contained in this little book are only
a small part of a large collection of Indian
folk-tales, made by Mr. Crooke in the course
of the Ethnological Survey of the North-West Provinces
and Oudh. Some were recorded by the
collector from the lips of the jungle-folk of Mirz&aacute;pur;
others by his native assistant, Pandit R&aacute;mghar&iacute;b
Chaub&eacute;. Besides these, a large number were received
from all parts of the Provinces in response to a circular
issued by Mr. J. C. Nesfield, the Director of Public
Instruction, to all teachers of village schools.</div>

<p>The present selection is confined to the Beast Stories,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>which are particularly interesting as being mostly indigenous
and little affected by so-called Aryan influence.
Most of them are new, or have been published only
in the <i>North Indian Notes and Queries</i> (referred to as
<i>N.I.N.Q.</i>).</p>

<div class='center'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the re-telling, for which Mr. Rouse is responsible,
a number of changes have been made. The text of
the book is meant for children, and consequently the
first aim has been to make an interesting story. Those
who study folk-tales for any scientific purpose will
find all such changes marked in the Notes. If the
change is considerable, the original document is
summarised. It should be added that these documents
are merely brief Notes in themselves, without
literary interest. The Notes also give<br />
the source of each tale, and a few<br />
obvious parallels, or references<br />
to the literature<br />
of the subject.</div>

<h2><a name="The_Talking_Thrush" id="The_Talking_Thrush"></a>The Talking Thrush</h2>
<div><span class='notes'><a href="#n1">[Notes]</a></span></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 132px;">
<img src="images/i_016.png" width="132" height="175" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp;  CERTAIN man had a garden, and in his
garden he sowed cotton seeds. By-and-by
the cotton seeds grew up into a cotton
bush, with big brown pods upon it.
These pods burst open when they are
ripe; and you can see the fluffy white
cotton bulging all white out of the
pods. There was a Thrush in this garden, and the
Thrush thought within herself how nice and soft the
cotton looked. She plucked out some of it to line her
nest with; and never before was her sleep so soft as
it was on that bed of cotton.</div>

<p>Now this Thrush had a clever head; so she thought
something more might be done with cotton besides lining
a nest. In her flights abroad she used often to pass by
the door of a Cotton-carder. The Cotton-carder had a
thing like a bow, made of a piece of wood, and a thong
of leather tying the ends together into a curve. He
used to take the cotton, and pile it in a heap; then
he took the carding-bow, and twang-twang-twanged it
among the heap of cotton, so that the fibres or threads
of it became disentangled. Then he rolled it up into
oblong balls, and sold it to other people, who made
it into thread.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The Thrush often watched the Cotton-carder at work.
Every day after dinner, she went to the cotton tree, and
plucked out a fluff of cotton in her beak and hid it away.
She went on doing this till at last she had quite a little
heap of cotton all of her own. At least, it was not really
her own, because she stole it; but then you cannot get
policemen to take up a Thrush for stealing, and as men
catch Thrushes and put them in a cage all for nothing, it
is only fair the birds should have their turn.</p>

<p>When the heap of cotton was big enough, our Thrush
flew to the house of the Cotton-carder, and sat down in
front of him.</p>

<p>"Good day, Man," said the Thrush.</p>

<p>"Good day, Birdie," said the Cotton-carder. The
Thrush was not a bit afraid, because she knew he was
a kind man, who never caught little birds to put them
in a cage. He liked better to hear them singing free
in the woods.</p>

<p>"Man," said the Thrush, "I have a heap of beautiful
cotton, and I'll tell you what. You shall have half of
it, if you will card the rest and make it up into balls
for me."</p>

<p>"That I will," said the man; "where is it?"</p>

<p>"If you will come with me," said the Thrush, "I'll
show you."</p>

<p>So the Thrush flew in front, and the man followed
after, and they came to the place where the hoard of
cotton was hidden away. The man took the cotton
home, and carded it, and made it into balls. Half of
the cotton he took for his trouble, and the rest he gave
back to the Thrush. He was so honest that he did not
cheat even a bird, although he could easily have done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
so. For birds cannot count: and if you find a nest
full of eggs, and take one or two, the mother-bird will
never miss them; but if you take all, the bird is unhappy.</p>

<p>Not far away from the Carder lived a Spinner. This
man used to put a ball of cotton on a stick, and then he
pulled out a bit of the cotton without breaking it, and
tied it to another little stick with a weight on it. Then
he twisted the weight, and set it a-spinning; and as it
span, he held the cotton ball in one hand, and pulled
out the cotton with the other, working it between finger
and thumb to keep it fine. Thus the spindle went on
spinning, and the cotton went on twisting, until it was
twisted into thread. That is why the man was called a
Spinner. It looks very easy to do, when you can do it;
but it is really very hard to do well.</p>

<p>To this Spinner the Thrush came, and after bidding
him good day, said she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Spinner, I have some balls of cotton all ready
to spin into thread. Will you spin one half of them into
thread for me, if I give you the other half?"</p>

<p>"That I will," said Mr. Spinner; and away they
went to find the cotton balls, Thrush first and Spinner
following.</p>

<p>In a very few days the Spinner had spun all the
cotton into the finest thread. Then he took a pair of
scales, and weighed it into two equal parts (he was
an honest man, too): half he kept for himself, and the
other half he gave to the Thrush.</p>

<p>The next thing this clever Thrush did was to fly to the
house of a Weaver. The Weaver used to buy thread, and
fasten a number of threads to a wooden frame, called a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
loom, which was made of two upright posts, with another
bar fastened across the top. The threads were hung to
the cross-bar, and a little stone was tied to the bottom of
each, to keep it steady. Then the Weaver wound some
more thread around a long stick called a shuttle; and
the shuttle he pushed in front of one thread and behind
the next, until it had gone right across the whole of the
threads, in and out. Then he pushed it back in the same
way, and after a bit, the upright threads and the cross-threads
were woven together and made a piece of cloth.</p>

<p>The Thrush flew down to the Weaver, and they made
the same bargain as before. The Weaver wove all the
thread into pieces of cloth, and half he kept for himself,
but the other half he returned to the Thrush.</p>

<p>So now the Thrush had some beautiful cloth, and I
dare say you wonder what she wanted it for. As you
have not been inquisitive, I will tell you: she wanted
clothes to dress herself. The Thrush had noticed that
men and women walking about wore clothes, and being
an ambitious Thrush, and eager to rise in the world, she
felt it would not be proper to go about without any
clothes on. So she now went to a Tailor, and said to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good Mr. Tailor, I have some pieces of very fine
cloth, and I should be much obliged if you would make
a part of it into clothes for me. You shall have one half
of the cloth for your trouble."</p>

<p>The Tailor was very glad of this job, as times were
slack. So he took the cloth, and at once set to work.
Half of it he made into a beautiful dress for the Thrush,
with a skirt and jacket, and sleeves in the latest fashion;
and as there was a little cloth left over, and he was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
honest Tailor, he made her also a pretty little hat to
put on her head.</p>

<p>Then the Thrush was indeed delighted, and felt there
was little more to desire in the world. She put on her
skirt, and her jacket with fashionable sleeves, and the
little hat, and looked at her image in a river, and was
mightily pleased with herself. Now she became so
vain that nothing would do, but she must show herself
to the King.</p>

<p>So she flew and flew, and away she flew, until she
came to the King's palace. Into the King's palace she
flew, and into the great hall where the King sat and
the Queen and all the courtiers. There was a peg high
up on the wall, and the Thrush perched on this peg,
and began to sing.</p>

<p>"Oh, look there!" cried the Queen, who was the first
to see this wonderful sight&mdash;"see, a Thrush in a jacket
and skirt and a pretty hat!"</p>

<p>Everybody looked at the Thrush singing on her peg,
and clapped their hands.</p>

<p>"Come here, Birdie," said the King, "and show the
Queen your pretty clothes."</p>

<p>The Thrush felt highly flattered, and flew down upon
the table, and took off her jacket to show the Queen.
Then she flew back to her peg, and watched to see what
would happen.</p>

<p>The Queen turned over the jacket in her hand, and
laughed. Then she folded it up, and put it in her
pocket.</p>

<p>"Give me my jacket!" twittered the Thrush. "I
shall catch cold, and besides, it is not proper for a lady
to be seen without a jacket."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they all laughed, and the King said, "Come
here, Mistress Thrush, and you shall have your jacket."</p>

<p>Down flew the Thrush upon the table again; but
the King caught her, and held her fast.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" squeaked the Thrush, struggling to
get free.</p>

<p>But the King would not let her go. I am afraid that
although he was a King, he was not so honest as the
Carder or the Spinner, and cared less for his word than
the Weaver and the Tailor.</p>

<p>"Greedy King," said the Thrush, "to covet my little
jacket!"</p>

<p>"I covet more than your jacket," said the King; "I
covet you, and I am going to chop you up into little
bits."</p>

<p>Then he began to chop her up into bits. As she
was being chopped up, the Thrush said, "The King
snips and cuts like a Tailor, but he is not so honest!"</p>

<p>When the King had finished chopping her up, he
began to wash the pieces. And each piece, as he washed
it, called out, "The King scours and scrubs like a
washerwoman, but he is not so honest!"</p>

<p>Then the King put the pieces of the Thrush into a
frying-pan with oil, and began to fry them. But the
pieces went on calling out, "The King is like a cook,
frying and sputtering, but he is not so honest!"</p>

<p>When she was fried, the King ate her up. From
within the body of the King still the Thrush kept calling
out, "I am inside the King! It is just like the inside
of any other man, only not so honest!"</p>

<p>The King became like a walking musical-box, and he
did not like it at all, but it was his own fault. Wherever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
he went, everybody heard the Thrush crying out from
inside the King, "Just like any other man, only not so
honest!" Everybody that heard this began to despise
the King.</p>

<p>At last the King could stand it no longer. He sent
for his doctor, and said, "Doctor, you must cut this
talking bird out of me."</p>

<p>"Your majesty will die, if I do," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"I shall die if you don't," answered the King, "for I
cannot endure being made a fool of."</p>

<div class='center'>
So there was nothing for it: the Doctor took his<br />
knives, and made a hole in the King, and pulled out the<br />
Thrush. Strange to say, the pieces of the Thrush had all<br />
joined together again, and away she flew; but her beautiful<br />
clothes were all gone. However, it was a lesson she<br />
never forgot; and after that, she slept soft in her nest<br />
of cotton, and never again tried to ape her betters. As<br />
for the King, he died; and a good riddance too.<br />
His son became king in his stead; and all<br />
life long he remembered his father's<br />
miserable death, and kept all his<br />
promises to men, and beasts,<br />
and birds.<br /></div>

<h2><a name="The_Rabbit_and_the_Monkey" id="The_Rabbit_and_the_Monkey"></a>The Rabbit and the Monkey</h2>
<div><span class='notes'><a href="#n2">[Notes]</a></span></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 145px;">
<img src="images/i_023.png" width="145" height="200" alt="O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>NCE upon a time, there lived in the
mountains a Rabbit and a Monkey,
who were great friends. One day,
as they sat by the roadside hobnobbing
together, who should come
by but a man with a bamboo pole
over his shoulder, and at each end
of the pole was a bundle hung to a
string; and there were plantains in
one bundle, and sugar in the other.</div>

<p>Said the Monkey to the Rabbit, "Friend of my
heart, do as I shall tell you. Go and sit upon the
road in front of that man, and as soon as he sees
you, run&mdash;he is sure to drop his load and follow.
Then I will pick up his load, and hide it safely; and
when you come back, we will share it together."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done: the Rabbit ran, and
the man dropped his burden and ran after him; while
the Monkey, who had been hiding in the tall grass
by the wayside, pounced upon the sugar and the
plantains, and climbed up into a tree, and began to
gobble them up at his leisure.</p>

<p>By-and-by the man came back, hot and empty-handed,
and finding that his goods were gone as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as the Rabbit, cursed loudly, and went home to be
scolded by his wife.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_024.png" width="500" height="344" alt="Man with pole carrying burdens" title="" />
</div>

<p>Soon the Rabbit came back too, and began hunting
about for his friend the Monkey. High and low he
searched, and not a trace could he find; till he happened
to cast his eyes aloft, and lo and behold, there was
Mr. Monkey up in a tree, munching away with every
sign of enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Hullo, friend," said he, "come down out of
that."</p>

<p>"I'm very comfortable here, thank you," said the
Monkey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"But where's my share?" asked the Rabbit indignantly.</p>

<p>"All gone, all gone," mumbled the Monkey, and
pelted him with the plantain-peel and balls of paper
made out of the packets where the sugar had been.
"Why did you stay so long? I got hungry, and could
not wait any longer."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 367px;"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
<img src="images/i_026.png" width="367" height="500" alt="Man talking to rabbit" title="" />
</div>
<p>The Rabbit thought his friend was joking, and would
not believe it; but it was only too true&mdash;the greedy
creature had not left a scrap.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it?" said the poor Rabbit.</p>

<p>"If you don't believe me, come and see," said the
Monkey, and seizing the Rabbit by his long ears, he
hauled him up into the tree; and after mocking him,
and making great game, he left him there, and went
away.</p>

<p>Now the Rabbit was afraid to jump down from
such a height, for fear of breaking his neck, so up in
the tree he remained for a long time. Many animals
passed under the tree, but none took pity on the
rabbit, until at last came an old and foolish Rhinoceros,
who rubbed his withered hide against the trunk.</p>

<p>"Kind Rhinoceros," said the Rabbit, "let me jump
down upon your back."</p>

<p>The Rhinoceros, being a simple creature, agreed.
Down came the Rabbit, with such a thud, that the
Rhinoceros fell on his stupid old nose, and broke his
fat old neck, and died.</p>



<p>The Rabbit ran away, and away he ran, until he
came to the King's palace; and he hid under the King's
golden throne. By-and-by in came the King, and in
came the court; all the grandees stood around in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
golden robes, glittering with rubies and diamonds, and
their swords were girt about their waists. Suddenly
they all heard a terrific sneeze!</p>

<p>Everybody said, "God bless you," while the King
thundered out: "Who has the bad manners to sneeze
in the King's presence?" Everybody looked at his
neighbour, and wondered who did it. "Off with his
head," shouted the King.</p>

<p>Another sneeze came. This time, however, everybody
was on the watch, and they noticed that the
sound came from under the King's golden throne. So
they dived in, and lugged out the Rabbit, looking more
dead than alive.</p>

<p>"All right," said the King, "off with his head." The
executioner ran to get his sword.</p>

<p>But our friend the Rabbit, for all he was frightened,
had his wits about him; and sitting up on his hind-legs,
and putting his two fore-paws together, he said
respectfully, "O great King, strike, but hear. If thou
wilt send a score of men with me, I will give thee a
dead Rhinoceros."</p>

<p>The King laughed, the courtiers laughed loud and
long. However, just to see what would come of it,
the King gave him a score of men.</p>

<p>The Rabbit led them to the place where the Rhinoceros
fell on his stupid old nose, and there he lay
dead. With great difficulty the men dragged the
Rhinoceros home. They were very pleased to get a
Rhinoceros, because his horn is good for curing
many diseases, and the court physician ground his
horn into powder, and made out of it a most wonderful
medicine. And the King was so pleased, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he gave the Rabbit a fine new coat, and a horse to
ride on.</p>

<p>So the Rabbit put on his fine coat, and got on the
back of his horse, and rode off.</p>

<p>On the way, who should meet him but his friend
the Monkey.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" says the Monkey, "where did you get all
that finery?"</p>

<p>"The King gave it to me," says the Rabbit.</p>

<p>Says the Monkey, "And why should the King give
all this to a fool like you?"</p>

<p>The Rabbit replied, "I, whom you call a fool, got
it by sneezing under the King's golden throne; such
a lucky sneeze, that the soothsayers prophesied to
the King long life and many sons!" Then he rode
away.</p>

<p>The Monkey fell a-thinking how nice it would be
if he could get a fine coat and horse as the Rabbit had
done. "I can sneeze," thought he; "what if I try my
luck?"</p>

<p>So he scampered away, and away he scampered, till
he came to the King's palace, and hid himself under the
King's golden throne. When the King came in, and all
his courtiers, in gorgeous array as before, our Monkey
underneath the throne sneezed in the most auspicious
manner he could contrive.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" thundered the King, glaring about
him. "Who has the bad manners to sneeze in the
King's presence?"</p>

<p>They searched about until they found the Monkey
hidden under the throne, and hauled him out.</p>

<p>"What hast thou, wily tree-climber," asked the King,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
"that I should not bid the executioner cut off thy
head?"</p>

<div class='center'>
The monkey had no answer ready. At last he<br />
said, "O King, I have some plantain-peel<br />
and pellets of paper." But<br />
the King was angry at this,<br />
and the greedy Monkey<br />
was led away, and<br />
his head was<br />
cut off.<br />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 174px;">
<img src="images/i_031-o.png" width="174" height="175" alt="O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>NCE there was a pair of Sparrows
that were very fond of each other,
and lived in a nest together as
happy as the day was long. The
hen laid eggs and sat upon them,
and the cock went about picking
up food for them both, and when
he had got food enough, he sat
on a twig close by the nest, and twittered for joy.</div>

<p>But it happened one day that a boy saw Cock Sparrow
pecking at some seeds, and he picked up a stone and
threw it at him, and killed him. So no food came home
that morning, and Hen Sparrow grew anxious, and at
last set out to find him.</p>

<p>In a little while she found his dead body lying in a
ditch. She ruffled up her feathers and began to cry.
"Who can have killed him?" she said; "my poor kind
husband, who never did harm to any one." Then a
Raven flew down from a tree, where he had been sitting,
and told her how a cruel boy had thrown a stone at
him and killed him for sport. He saw it, said the Raven,
as he was sitting on the tree.</p>

<p>Now Hen Sparrow determined to have her revenge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
She was so much troubled that she left her eggs to
hatch themselves, or to addle if they would; and gathering
some straw, she plaited it into a beautiful straw
carriage, with two old cotton-reels for wheels, and sticks
for the shafts. Then she went to the hole of a Rat who
was a friend of hers, and called down the hole, "Mr.
Rat! Mr. Rat!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Sparrow," said the Rat, coming out of the
hole and making a polite bow.</p>

<p>"Some one has thrown a stone at my husband and
killed him. Will you help me to get my revenge?"</p>

<p>"Why," said the Rat, "how can I help you?"</p>

<p>"By pulling me along in my carriage," said Mrs.
Sparrow.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said the Rat; "that I will." So he went
down into his hole again, and washed his face, and
combed his whiskers, and came up all spick and
span.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sparrow tied the shafts of the straw carriage
to the Rat, and Mrs. Sparrow got in, and off they
went.</p>

<p>On the road they met a Scorpion. Said the Scorpion&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whither away, Mrs. Sparrow and Mr. Rat?"</p>

<p>Said the Hen Sparrow, "My friend Mr. Rat is pulling
me along in my carriage of straw to punish a cruel boy
who threw a stone at my husband and killed him."</p>

<p>"Quite right too," said the Scorpion. "May I
come and help you? I have a beautiful sting in my
tail."</p>

<p>"Oh, please do! come and get in," said the
Sparrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In got the Scorpion, and away they went. By-and-by
they saw a Snake.</p>

<p>"Good day, and God bless you," says the Snake.
"Where are you going, may a mere reptile ask?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Scorpion and I are going to punish a cruel
boy who threw a stone and killed my husband."</p>

<p>"Shall I come and help you?" asked the Snake. "I
have fine teeth in my head to bite with."</p>

<p>"The more the merrier," replied Mrs. Sparrow. So
in he got. They had not gone far before who should
meet them but a Wolf.</p>

<p>"Hullo," says the Wolf gruffly; "where are you off
to, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rat is kind enough to draw me in my carriage,
and we are all going to punish a cruel boy who threw
a stone and killed my poor husband."</p>

<p>"May I come too?" growled the Wolf. "I can bite."
He opened his big jaws and snarled.</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind you are!" said Mrs. Sparrow. "Do
come! jump in, jump in!"</p>

<p>The poor Rat looked aghast at such a load to pull;
but he was a gentlemanly Rat, and so, having offered to
pull the carriage, he said nothing.</p>

<p>So the big Wolf got in, and nearly sat on the Scorpion's
tail; if he had, he wouldn't have sat long, I think.
However, the Scorpion got out of the way, and on they
went all four, the poor Rat pulling with all his might,
but rather slow at that.</p>

<p>In due time they arrived at the cruel boy's house.
His mother was cooking the dinner, and his father was
fast asleep in a chair. There was a river close by the
house, and the Wolf went down to the river, and hid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
himself there; the Snake crawled among the peats, and
the Scorpion began to climb up into the chair where
the man was sleeping.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Hen Sparrow flew in at the door and
twittered&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/i_034.png" width="280" height="400" alt="The boy ran" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Little boy! Little boy! There's a fish biting at
your night-line!"</p>

<p>Up jumped the boy, and out he ran, to look at the
night-line. But as he was stooping down and looking
at the line to see if any fish were hooked, the Wolf
pounced upon him, and bit him in the throat, and he
died.</p>

<p>Then the cruel boy's mother went out to get some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
peats, and as she put her hand in amongst them, the
Snake bit her, and she gave a shriek and fell down and
died. The shriek awoke her husband sleeping in his
chair, and he began to get up, but by this time the
Scorpion had climbed up the leg of the chair, so he
stung the man, and the man died too.</p>

<div class='center'>
Thus there was an end of the cruel boy who killed<br />
a harmless Sparrow for sport; and though his father<br />
and mother had done nothing, yet they ought not to<br />
have had a son so cruel, or, at least, they might have<br />
brought him up better. Anyhow, die they did, all three;<br />
and Mrs. Hen Sparrow was so delighted that she<br />
forgot all about her dead husband, and forgot<br />
her eggs which were getting addled,<br />
and went about chirruping until<br />
she found another husband,<br />
and made another nest,<br />
and (I am sorry to<br />
say) lived happily<br />
ever after.<br /></div>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /> &nbsp; MERCHANT was returning
home from a long journey,
riding upon a mule. As he
drew near home, night overtook
him; and he was forced to look
out for shelter. Seeing a mill
by the roadside, he knocked at
the door.</div>

<p>"Come in!" said the Miller.</p>

<p>"May I stay here for the night?" asked the Merchant.</p>

<p>"By all means," said the Miller, "if you pay me
well."</p>

<p>The Merchant thought this rather mean; because in
those days a stranger was made welcome everywhere
without paying anything. However, he made the best
of it, and came in. The Miller led off his mule to the
stable.</p>

<p>"Please take care of my mule," said the Merchant;
"I have still a long way to go."</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 243px;">
<img src="images/i_037.png" width="243" height="500" alt="&quot;The Merchant was much dismayed.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The Merchant was much dismayed.&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>"Oh," said the Miller, "your mule will be all right."
Then he rubbed him down and fed him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning the Merchant asked for his mule.</p>



<p>"I am very sorry,"
said the Miller; "he
must have got loose
last night, and I can't
find him anywhere."</p>

<p>The Merchant was
much dismayed. He
went out to look for
himself, and there, to
be sure, was his mule,
tied by the halter to
the mill.</p>

<p>"Why, look here,
Miller," says he, "here
is the mule!"</p>

<p>"Oh no," says the
Miller, "that mule is
mine."</p>

<p>"Yours?" said the
Merchant, getting angry.
"Last night your stable
was empty. And don't
you think I know my
own mule?"</p>

<p>"That is mine," said
the Miller again; "my
mill had a young mule
in the night, and that
is he."</p>

<p>The Merchant was
now very angry indeed; but he could not help himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
as he did not want to fight; he was a very peaceful
Merchant. So he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I have no doubt it's all right; but just to
satisfy me, let us ask the Rev. Dr. Jackal to decide
between us; and whatever he says I will abide by."</p>

<p>"Very good," answered the Miller; and away they
went to the den of his reverence the Jackal. Dr. Jackal
was sitting with his hind legs crossed, and smoking a
hubble-bubble.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 209px;">
<img src="images/i_038.png" width="209" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Good morning, worthy gentlemen," said the Jackal;
"how can I serve you?"</p>

<p>Said the Merchant, "Last night, my Lord Judge, I
lodged with this Miller here, and he took charge of my
mule; but now he says it has run away, though I saw it
with my own eyes tied by the halter to his mill. He says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that the mule I saw is his, and that his mill is the
mother of it, and that it was born last night while I
was asleep."</p>

<p>"Go back to the mill," said the Jackal, "and wait
for me. I will just wash my face, and then I'll settle
your business."</p>

<p>They went away, and waited a long time, but no
Jackal. Late in the afternoon, they got tired of waiting
for the Jackal, and determined to go and look for him.
There he was still, sitting in his den and smoking a
hubble-bubble.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come?" asked the Miller. "We
have been waiting for you all day."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear sir, I was too busy," said the Jackal.
"When I went to wash my face, I found that all the
water had caught fire; I have only just put it out."</p>

<p>"You must be mad, your reverence," said the Miller.
"Who ever heard of water catching fire?"</p>

<p>"And who ever heard," replied the Jackal, "of a
mill having a young mule?"</p>

<div class='center'>
The Miller saw that he was found out, and was so<br />
much ashamed that he gave back the mule to<br />
its owner, and the Merchant<br />
went home.<br /></div>

</div><div class='unindent'> <br /><br /> &nbsp; MERCHANT was going along
the road one day with a sack
of peas on the back of an Ox.
The Ox was stung by a Fly,
and gave a kick, and down fell
the sack. A Mouse was passing
by, and the Merchant said,
"Mousie, if you will help me
up with this sack I will give you a pea." The Mouse
helped him up with the sack and got a pea for his
trouble. He stole another, and a third he found on
the road.</div>

<p>When he got home with his three peas he planted
them in front of his hole. As he was planting them he
said to them, "If you are not all three sprouting by to-morrow
I'll cut you in pieces and give you to the black
Ox." The peas were terribly frightened, and the next
morning they had already begun to sprout, and each of
them had two shoots. Then he said, "If I don't find
you in blossom to-morrow I'll cut you in pieces and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
give you to the black Ox." When he went to look next
day they were all in blossom. So he said, "If I don't
find ripe peas on you to-morrow I'll cut you in pieces
and give you to the black Ox." Next day they had
pods full of ripe peas on them.</p>

<p>So every day he used to eat lots of peas, and in
this manner he got very fat. One day a pretty young
lady Mouse came to see him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sleekie," said she; "how are you?"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Squeakie," said he; "I'm quite well,
thank you."</p>

<p>"Why, Sleekie," said she, "how fat you are."</p>

<p>"Am I?" said he. "I suppose that's because I have
plenty to eat."</p>

<p>"What do you eat, Sleekie?" asked the pretty young
lady Mouse.</p>

<p>"Peas, Squeakie," said the other.</p>

<p>"Where do you get them, Sleekie?"</p>

<p>"They grow all of themselves in my garden, Squeakie."</p>

<p>"Will you give me some, please?" asked the lady
Mouse.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, if you will stay in my garden, you may have
as many as you like."</p>

<p>So Squeakie stayed in Sleekie's garden, and they
both ate so many peas that they got fatter and fatter
every day.</p>

<p>One day Squeakie said to Sleekie, "Let's try which
can get into the hole quickest." Squeakie was slim, and
she had not been at the peas so long as Sleekie, so she
got into the hole easily enough; but Sleekie was so fat
that he could not get in at all.</p>

<p>He was very much frightened, and went off in hot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
haste to the Carpenter, and said to him, "Carpenter,
please pare off a little flesh from my ribs, so that I can
get into my hole."</p>

<p>"Do you think I have nothing better to do than
paring down your ribs?" said the Carpenter angrily,
and went on with his work.</p>

<p>The Mouse went to the King, and said, "O King, I
can't get into my hole, and the Carpenter will not pare
down my ribs; will you make him do it?"</p>

<p>"Get out," said the King; "do you think I have
nothing better to do than look after your ribs?"</p>

<p>So the Mouse went to the Queen. Said he, "Queen,
I can't get into my hole, and the King won't tell the
Carpenter to pare down my ribs. Please divorce him."</p>

<p>"Bother you and your ribs," said the Queen; "I am
not going to divorce my husband because you have
made yourself fat by eating too much."</p>

<p>The Mouse went to the Snake. "Snake, bite the
Queen, and tell her to divorce the King, because he will
not tell the Carpenter to pare my ribs down and let me
get into my hole."</p>

<p>"Get away," said the Snake; "or I'll swallow you
up, ribs and all; the fatter you are, the better I shall
be pleased."</p>

<p>He went to the Stick, and said, "Stick, beat the
Snake, because she won't bite the Queen, who won't
divorce the King and make him tell the Carpenter to
pare down my ribs, and let me get into my hole."</p>

<p>"Off with you," said the Stick; "I'm sleepy, because
I have just beaten a thief; I can't be worried about
your ribs."</p>

<p>He went to the Furnace, and said, "Furnace, burn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Stick, and make it beat the Snake, that he may bite
the Queen and make her divorce the King, who won't
tell the Carpenter to pare down my ribs, and let me get
into my hole."</p>

<p>"Get along with you," said the Furnace; "I am
cooking the King's dinner, and I have no time now to
see about your ribs."</p>

<p>He went to the Ocean, and said, "Ocean, put out
the Fire, and make it burn the Stick, so that it may beat
the Snake, and the Snake may bite the Queen, and she
may divorce the King, who won't tell the Carpenter to
pare down my ribs, and let me get into my hole."</p>

<p>"Don't bother me," said the Ocean; "it's high tide,
and all the fishes are jumping about, and giving me
no rest."</p>

<p>He went to the Elephant, and said, "O Elephant,
drink up the Ocean, that it may put out the Fire, and
the Fire may burn the Stick, and the Stick may beat the
Snake, and the Snake may bite the Queen, and the
Queen may divorce the King, and make him tell the
Carpenter to pare down my ribs, and let me get into
my hole."</p>

<p>"Go away, little Mouse," said the Elephant; "I have
just drunk up a whole lake, and I really can't drink any
more."</p>

<p>He went to the Creeper, and said, "Dear Creeper,
do please choke the Elephant, that he may drink up the
Ocean, and the Ocean may put out the Fire, and the Fire
may burn the Stick, and the Stick may beat the Snake,
and the Snake may bite the Queen, and the Queen may
divorce the King, and the King may tell the Carpenter
to pare down my ribs, and let me get into my hole."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not I," says the Creeper; "I am stuck fast here
to this tree, and I couldn't get away to please a fat little
Mouse."</p>

<p>Then he went to the Scythe, and said, "Scythe,
please cut loose the Creeper, that it may choke the
Elephant, and the Elephant may drink up the Ocean,
and the Ocean may put out the Fire, and the Fire may
burn the Stick, and the Stick may beat the Snake, and
the Snake may bite the Queen, and the Queen may
divorce the King, and the King may tell the Carpenter
to pare down my ribs, and let me get into my hole."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the Scythe, who is always
sharp.</p>

<div class='center'>
So the Scythe cut the Creeper loose, and the Creeper<br />
began to choke the Elephant, and the Elephant ran off<br />
and began to drink up the Ocean, and the Ocean began<br />
to put out the Fire, and the Fire began to burn the<br />
Stick, and the Stick began to beat the Snake, and<br />
the Snake began to bite the Queen, and the<br />
Queen told the King she was going to<br />

</div><div class='unindent'>NCE King Solomon was hunting all alone
in the forest. Night fell, and King
Solomon lay down under a tree to sleep.
Over his head, on the branch of a tree,
sat a huge Owl; and the Owl hooted so
loud and so long, Too-whit too-woo!
Too-whit too-woo! that Solomon could
not sleep. Solomon looked up at the Owl, and said&mdash;</div>

<p>"Tell me, O Owl, why do you hoot all night long

his solemn old head to and fro. He was a melancholy

<p>Thought Solomon to himself, "I don't remember
reading that story in Genesis, but perhaps he is right.
I must look it up when I get home." Then he spoke
to the Owl once more, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now, good Owl, tell me why you drink no
water at night?"</p>

<p>Said the Owl&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Since water all the world did drown<br />
In Noah's day, I will drink none.<br />
Were I to drink a single drop,<br />
My life would then most likely stop."<br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Solomon was delighted to find the Owl so wise. "O
my Owl," said he, "all my life long I have been looking
for a counsellor who had reasons to give for what he
did; I have never found one until I found you. Now
I beg you to come home with me to-morrow, and you
shall be my chief counsellor, and whatever I purpose I
will first ask your advice."</p>

<div class='center'>
The Owl was equally delighted, and said, "Thank<br />
you." Thinking of the greatness that was<br />
to be his, the Owl stopped crying<br />
Too-whit! too-woo! and<br />
Solomon went<br />
to sleep.<br />

<h2><a name="The_Camels_Neck" id="The_Camels_Neck"></a>The Camel's<br />Neck</h2>
<div><span class='notes'><a href="#n7">[Notes]</a></span></div>

<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time there was a
very religious Camel; at least, he
was religious after the fashion of his
country, that is, he used to mortify his
flesh by fasting, and scratch himself
with thorns, and lie awake all night
meditating upon the emptiness of the
world. That is what men used to do
in that country, in order to please their
gods. One of these gods was very much
pleased with the piety of the Camel; so
one night, as the Camel was fasting, and
saying over and over to himself, "Vanity
of vanities, all is vanity," the god<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
appeared before him. He was a curious-looking god,
and he had four hands instead of two; but the Camel
did not mind that, nor did he laugh; on the contrary,
he went down on his knees and bowed before him.</div>

<p>"O Camel," said this god, "I have seen your fasting
and heard your prayers; and I have come to reward
you. Choose what boon you like, and it shall be yours."</p>
<p>"O mighty god, I should like to have a neck eight
miles long."</p></div></td>
</tr></table></div>


<p>The god answered, "Be it so!" and immediately the
Camel felt his neck shooting out like a telescope, until it
was eight miles long. It shot out so fast, that the Camel
found it hard to escape running his head against the
trees. However, he steered it successfully, barring a
bump or two; and as by the time his neck stopped
growing he was far out of sight of the god, he could
not even say thank you.</p>

<p>Now perhaps you will wonder why this Camel wanted
a neck so long as eight miles? I will tell you. The
reason was, that for all his fastings and penances, he was
a lazy Camel, and he wanted to graze without the trouble
of walking about. And now he could easily graze for
a distance of eight miles all round in a circle, without
moving from the spot where he lay. But it was rather
dangerous, though he thought nothing of that; for when
his head was grazing a few miles away, the hunters
might stick a spear into his body, or tie his legs together,
without his seeing them.</p>

<p>All the summer the Camel had a fine time of it; he
lay still and comfortable and sent his head foraging
around, and strange to say, no harm happened to him.
But before long the rainy season began. In the rainy
season there are storms every day, and it rains cats and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dogs. So when the rain began, the Camel wanted to
keep dry, but he could not at first find a shed or a shelter
eight miles long, or anything like it. At last he lit on a
long winding cave that held most of his long neck. So
he ran his neck into the cave, and lay still, with the rain
pouring upon his body.</p>

<p>This was bad enough, but worse was to come. For
it happened that in this cave lived a He-jackal and a
She-jackal.</p>

<p>When the Jackals saw this extraordinary neck winding
along their cave, they were frightened, and hid away.</p>

<p>"What is this snake?" said the He-jackal to his
wife.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, I don't know!" whimpered his wife, "I
never saw a snake like this."</p>

<p>They kept quiet, the head passed out of view into the
inner part of the cave; then after a while, the creature
lay still.</p>

<p>"Let us smell him!" said the He-jackal.</p>

<p>They smelt him. "He smells nice," said the She-jackal;
"not a bit like a snake."</p>

<p>"Let us taste him!" said the He-jackal.</p>

<p>They took a bite; the Camel stirred restlessly. They
took another bite, and liked that better still. They went
on biting. The Camel curled round his head to see what
was going on; but before the Camel's head could get
back more than a mile or two, he grew so weak from
loss of blood, that he could move no more, and he died.</p>

<p>So died the idle Camel, because the god granted him
his foolish wish. Perhaps our wishes are often just as
foolish, if we only knew it; and perhaps if they were
fulfilled they would be the bane of us, as happened to
the lazy and religious Camel.</p>

Said the Quail to the Fowler&mdash;</div>

<p>"O Fowler, I know four things
that will be useful for you to know."</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked the
Fowler.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Quail, "I don't
mind telling you three of them now.
The first is: Fast caught, fast keep; never let a thing
go when once you have got it. The second is: He is
a fool that believes everything he hears. And the third
is this: It's of no use crying over spilt milk."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fowler thought these very sensible maxims.
"And what is the fourth?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Quail, "you must set me free if you
want to hear the fourth."</p>

<p>The Fowler, who was a simple fellow, set the Quail
free. The Quail fluttered up into a tree, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see you take no notice of what I tell you. Fast
caught, fast keep, I said; and yet you have let
me go."</p>

<p>"Why, so I have," said the Fowler, and scratched
his head. He was a foolish Fowler, I think. "Well,
never mind; what is the fourth thing? You promised
to tell me, and I am sure an honourable Quail will never
break his word."</p>

<p>"The fourth thing I have to tell you is this: In my
inside is a beautiful diamond, weighing ten pounds.
And if you had not let me go, you would have had that
diamond, and you need never have done any more work
in all your life."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear, what a fool I am!" cried the
Fowler. He fell on his face, and clutched at the grass,
and began to cry.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the Quail. "He is a fool
who believes everything he hears."</p>

<p>"Eh? what?" said the Fowler, and stopped crying.</p>

<p>"Do you think a little carcase like mine can hold
a diamond as big as your head?" asked the Quail,
roaring with laughter. "And even if it were true,
where's the use of crying over spilt milk?"</p>

<p>The Quail spread his wings. "Good-bye," said
he; "better luck next time, Fowler." And he flew
away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

The Fowler sat up. "Well," said he, "that's true,<br />

</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp; &nbsp;MOUSE one day met a Frog, whom he knew
very well; but the Frog turned up his flat
nose, and would not speak to him.</div>

<p>"Friend Frog," said the Mouse, "why are
you so proud to-day?"</p>

<p>"Because I am King of the Kites," said
Froggie.</p>

<p>You must not suppose that this means a paper kite
with a tail. There is a kind of bird called a Kite; it
is like a Hawk, only bigger. How absurd it was of
this Frog, who could not even fly, to call himself the
King of the Kites! And the Mouse was just as absurd,
for he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense! I am King of the Kites!"</p>

<p>I don't know whether they really believed this themselves,
or whether they were only trying to show off.
Anyhow, both stuck to it stoutly, and a pretty quarrel
was the result. The Mouse grew red in the face; and
as for Froggie, he was nearly bursting with rage.</p>

<p>At last they agreed to refer the decision to a council.
The council was made up of a Bat, a Squirrel, and a
Parrot. The Parrot took the chair, because he was the
biggest, and also because he could talk most, and
was therefore thought to be wise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I vote for the Mouse," said the Bat; not that he
knew anything about it, but you see a Bat is very like
a Mouse, and he wanted to stand up for the family.</p>

<p>"And I," said the Squirrel, "vote for my friend
Froggie." He knew nothing about it either, but he
wanted to show that even a Squirrel has an opinion of
his own.</p>

<p>So it fell to the Parrot to give the casting vote, and
decide the matter. He took a long time to decide,
about two hours; and while he was thinking, and the
others were all intent to hear what he should say, down
from the sky swooped a Kite; and the Kite stuck one
claw into the Mouse's back, and one claw into the Frog,
and carried them both away to his nest, and ate them
for dinner.</p>

<div class='center'>
So that was the end of the two Kings of the Kites.<br />
The other three creatures, in a great fright,<br />
made themselves scarce, lest the<br />
Kite should come back and<br />

</div><div class='unindent'>NCE a Camel was grazing in a
forest. He had a ring in his nose,
as the custom is, and to the ring
was tied a string, by which the
Camel's master used to lead him
about. As the Camel grazed, this
leading-string became entangled
in a bush, and the Camel could
not get it loose. This misfortune so much confused
the mind of the Camel that he did not know what
to do.</div>

<p>Suddenly, as the Camel was struggling to get free
from the bush, a Jackal appeared.</p>

<p>"Brother Jackal," said the Camel, "do please set
me free from this bush."</p>

<p>"Brother Camel," said the Jackal, "I will set you
free, only you must pay me for it. Do not the wise
say, 'Even a brother will not serve thee for nothing'?"</p>

<p>"What shall I pay you, brother Jackal? I am a
very poor Camel."</p>

<p>"You shall pay me," quoth the Jackal, "a pound of
your flesh."</p>

<p>This was a hard condition, but there was nothing
for it, "Better to lose a pound of my flesh," thought the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Camel, "than lose my life." So he agreed to pay the
Jackal a pound of flesh.</p>

<p>Then the Jackal set the Camel free, and the Camel
sat down on the ground and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am ready; take your pound of flesh."</p>

<p>"Open your mouth, then," said the Jackal.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the Camel.</p>

<p>"Because I choose to take my pound of flesh from
your tongue."</p>

<p>This was a terrible blow. The Camel could not
agree, because he knew that if his tongue were torn
out, he was bound to die.</p>

<p>So he said, "I did not promise you my tongue."</p>

<p>"You did," said the Jackal.</p>

<p>"Don't tell lies," said the Camel; "where are your
witnesses?"</p>

<p>Away trotted the Jackal to find a witness. First he
asked the Lion if he would bear witness that he heard
the Camel promise to give his tongue. He promised
to give him the half of all he should get, as a
reward.</p>

<p>"Go away," said the King of Beasts; "I am a Lion,
not a liar."</p>

<p>Then he asked the Tiger, but the Tiger said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't care for Camel's meat, so it isn't worth my
while."</p>

<p>And so the Jackal tried one beast after another, but
none of them would help him, until he came to the
Wolf.</p>

<p>"Friend Wolf," said the Jackal, "if you will only
swear that you heard the Camel promise me his tongue,
you shall have half."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Half a tongue?" quoth the Wolf; "that's poor
provender."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the Jackal, "half the Camel. Don't
you see that if we tear out his tongue, the Camel will
soon bleed to death."</p>

<p>"True, so he will," said the Wolf. "Well, I agree."</p>

<p>So the Wolf and the Jackal went back to the Camel,
and the Wolf said, raising his right forepaw to heaven&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swear by heaven that I heard this Camel promise
to give his tongue to this Jackal."</p>

<p>Of course this was a lie, and they all knew it; but
the Camel did not like to appear mean, and besides,
they were two to one.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Camel; "come and take it."
The Camel opened his mouth wide. The Jackal put
his head in the Camel's mouth, and as he did so, the
Camel curled his tongue backward, so that the Jackal
could not reach it.</p>

<p>The Jackal pulled his head out again, and said to
the Wolf&mdash;</p>

<p>"My mouth is too small, you try now&mdash;you have
a big gape."</p>

<p>Then the Wolf put his head in the Camel's mouth.
The Camel curled his tongue back and back, and the
Wolf pushed in his head further and further; at last
all the Wolf's head was inside. Then the Camel snapped
his jaws together upon the Wolf's neck.</p>

<p>"O Daddy Camel," said the Wolf, half throttled;
"what is this?"</p>

<p>"This," said the Jackal, rolling up the whites of his
eyes to the sky in a most pious fashion; "this is the
result of telling a lie." The Camel said nothing at all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
but simply throttled the Wolf to death, and the Jackal
ran away.</p>

<div class='center'>
I think you will agree with me, that the Jackal, who<br />
made the Wolf tell a lie, was wickeder than the Wolf<br />
who told it; but yet he laughed at the Wolf, and<br />
got off himself scot-free. That often happens<br />
in this world; but we will hope that some<br />
other time his sin was bound to<br />
find him out.<br />

</div><div class='unident'><br />NCE upon a time, a snake went out
of his hole to take an airing. He
crawled about, greatly enjoying the
scenery and the fresh whiff of the
breeze, until, seeing an open door,
he went in. Now this door was the
door of the palace of the King, and
inside was the King himself, with all
his courtiers.</div>

<p>Imagine their horror at seeing a
huge Snake crawling in at the door.
They all ran away except the King, who felt that his
rank forbade him to be a coward, and the King's son.
The King called out for somebody to come and kill the
Snake; but this horrified them still more, because in
that country the people believed it to be wicked to
kill any living thing, even snakes, and scorpions, and
wasps. So the courtiers did nothing, but the young
Prince obeyed his father, and killed the Snake with
his stick.</p>

<p>After a while the Snake's wife became anxious, and
set out in search of her husband. She too saw the open
door of the palace, and in she went. O horror! there on
the floor lay the body of her husband, all covered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
blood, and quite dead. No one saw the Snake's wife
crawl in; she inquired from a white ant what had
happened, and when she found that the young Prince
had killed her husband, she made a vow, that as he
had made her a widow, so she would make his wife a
widow.</p>

<p>That night, while all the world was asleep, the Snake
crept into the Prince's bedroom, and coiled around his
neck. The Prince slept on, and when he awoke in the
morning, he was surprised to find his neck encircled with
the coils of a Snake. He was afraid to stir, so there he
remained, until the Prince's mother became anxious, and
went to see what was the matter. When she entered his
room, and saw him in this plight, she gave a loud shriek,
and ran off to tell the King.</p>

<p>"Call the archers," said the King. The archers came,
and the King told them to go into the Prince's room, and
shoot the Snake that was coiled about his neck. They
were so clever, that they could easily do this without
hurting the Prince at all.</p>

<p>In came the archers in a row, fitted the arrows to the
bows, the bows were raised ready to shoot, when, on
a sudden, from the Snake there issued a voice, which
spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O archers! wait, and hear me before you shoot.
It is not fair to carry out the sentence before you have
heard the case. Is not this good law, an eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth? Is it not so, O King?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the King, "that is our law."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Snake, "I plead the law. Your son
has made me a widow, so it is fair and right that I should
make his wife a widow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"That sounds right enough," said the King, "but right
and law are not always the same thing. We had better
ask somebody who knows."</p>

<p>They asked all the judges, but none of them could
tell the law of the matter. They shook their heads, and
said they would look up all their law-books, and see
whether anything of the sort had ever happened before,
and if so, how it had been decided. That is the way
judges used to decide cases in that country, though I
daresay it sounds to you a very funny way. It looked as
if they had not much sense in their own heads, and perhaps
that was true. The upshot of all was, that not a
judge would give any opinion; so the King sent messengers
all over the country-side, to see if they could find
somebody somewhere who knew something.</p>

<p>One of these messengers found a party of five
Shepherds, who were sitting upon a hill and trying to
decide a quarrel of their own. They gave their opinions
so freely, and in language so very strong, that the King's
messenger said to himself, "Here are the men for us.
Here are five men, each with an opinion of his own, and
all different." Post-haste he scurried back to the King,
and told him he had found at last some one ready to
judge the knotty point.</p>

<p>So the King and the Queen, and the Prince and
the Princess, and all the courtiers, got on horseback,
and away they galloped to the hill whereupon the five
Shepherds were sitting, and the Snake too went with
them, coiled round the neck of the Prince.</p>

<p>When they got to the Shepherds' hill, the Shepherds
were dreadfully frightened. At first they thought that
the strangers were a gang of robbers; and when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
saw that it was the King, their next thought was that one
of their misdeeds had been found out, and each of them
began thinking what was the last thing he had done,
and wondering, was it that? But the King and his
Court got off their horses, and said good-day in the most
civil way. So the Shepherds felt their minds set at ease
again. Then the King said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Worthy Shepherds, we have a question to put to
you, which not all the judges in all the courts of my
city have been able to solve. Here is my son, and here,
as you see, is a Snake coiled round his neck. Now,
the husband of this Snake came creeping into my palace
hall, and my son the Prince killed him; so this Snake,
who is the wife of the other, says that as my son has
made her a widow, so she has a right to widow my son's
wife. What do you think about it?"</p>

<p>The first Shepherd said, "I think she is quite right,
my lord King. If any one made my wife a widow, I
would pretty soon do the same to him."</p>

<p>This was brave language, and the other Shepherds
shook their heads and looked fierce. But the King
was puzzled, and could not quite understand it. You
see, in the first place, if the man's wife were a widow,
the man would be dead; and then it is hard to see how
he could do anything. So to make sure, the King asked
the second Shepherd whether that was his opinion too?</p>

<p>"Yes," said the second Shepherd; "now the Prince
has killed the Snake, the Snake has a right to kill the
Prince, if he can."</p>

<p>But that was not of much use either, as the Snake
was as dead as a door-nail. So the King passed on to
the third.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I agree with my mates," said the third Shepherd,
"because, you see, a Prince is a Prince, but then a
Snake is a Snake."</p>

<p>That was quite true, they all admitted; but it did not
seem to help the matter much. Then the King asked
the fourth Shepherd to say what he thought.</p>

<p>The fourth Shepherd said, "An eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth; so I think a widow should be a
widow, if so be she don't marry again."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 159px;">

<p>By this time the poor King was so puzzled that he
hardly knew whether he stood
on his head or his heels. But
there was still the fifth Shepherd
left, the oldest and wisest of them
all; and the fifth Shepherd said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O King, I should like to ask
two questions."</p>

<p>"Ask twenty, if you like," said
the King. He did not promise
to answer them, so he could afford to be generous.</p>

<p>"First, I ask the Princess how many sons she has?"</p>

<p>"Four," said the Princess.</p>

<p>"And how many sons has Mistress Snake here?"</p>

<p>"Seven," said the Snake.</p>

<p>"Then," said the old Shepherd, "it will be quite fair
for Mistress Snake to kill his Highness the Prince,
when her Highness the Princess has had three sons
more."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said the Snake. "Good-bye,
King, and all you good people. Send a message
when the Princess has had three more sons, and you
may count upon me&mdash;I will not fail you." So saying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
she uncoiled from the Prince's neck and slid away
among the grass.</p>

<div class='center'>
The King and the Prince and everybody shook hands<br />
with the wise old Shepherd, and went home<br />
again. And as the Princess never had any<br />
more sons at all, she and the Prince<br />
lived happily for many years;<br />
and if they are not dead<br />
they are living<br />
still.<br />

</div><div class='unindent'> <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;BEAUTIFUL young Swan lived by
a beautiful lake. All day long he
used to sail gracefully over the
water, curving his neck to look at
his own image, or pluming his
white wings; and when he was
tired, he would go to his nest in
the rushes, and sleep, or play with
his brothers and sisters.</div>

<p>In a tree above that lake was a Crow. You know
that Crows are dirty birds, and they feed on offal and
refuse, and people dislike them; but the Swan was white
and clean. Still, strange as it may seem, this Swan
struck up a fast friendship with the Crow. His mother
and father begged him to keep out of bad company, but
he would not listen to them. He had done better to
keep to his own kind, but wilful will have his way, and
the Swan was sorry for it too late.</p>

<p>One day the Crow said to his friend the Swan, "Come,
old boy, let us go and have some fun."</p>

<p>"I'm your Swan," says the other, and away they
flew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>They came to a tree, and under the tree was a very
pious man, saying his prayers.</p>

<p>"Here's a joke," said the Crow. "Now we shall see
sport."</p>

<p>He picked up a lump of mud from the ground, and
flew up into the tree, and then he dropped the mud,
splash, on the pious man's head.</p>

<p>This interrupted his prayers, and he could not help
feeling angry, although he was so pious. So up got he,
and looked about to see who had done the mischief.</p>

<p>By this time the mischievous Crow had flown off, and
he was caw-caw-cawing on another tree, out of reach.
But the Swan sat still: he was not learned in mischief,
and he did not know what to do. Then the pious man
looked up into the tree, and saw the Swan sitting there, so
of course he thought it was the Swan who had dropped a
piece of mud on his head. He had a big catapult with
him, so he put a stone in his catapult, and slick! he shot
the Swan.</p>

<p>Down fell the Swan with a great thud. He felt that
his end was near, and how sorry he was now that he had
had anything to do with the bad Crow. However, it was
too late now to be sorry, so he began to sing. They say
that Swans never sing in all their life, but when they are
about to die they sing beautifully; and this is what the
Swan sang to the pious man:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I am no Crow, as you must know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But a Swan that lived by a lovely lake;</span><br />
With bad companions I would go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now I die for a bad friend's sake."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='center'><br /><br />
Then the Swan died, and the pious man finished<br />
his prayers.<br /></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 152px;">
<img src="images/i_051b-a.png" width="152" height="150" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp;&nbsp;WOLF and an Ass were great
friends, and they spent most of
their time playing at an original
game of their own. The game
was easy enough to learn; you
could play it yourselves; and it
was this. First the Ass used to
run away from the Wolf as hard
as he could, and the Wolf used to follow; and then
the Wolf would run as hard as he could from the
Ass, and the Ass would follow.</div>

<p>One day, as the Wolf was running away full tilt from
the Ass, a Boy saw them.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha," said the Boy, "what a coward that
Wolf is, to run away from an Ass." He thought,
you see, that the Wolf was afraid of being eaten by
the Ass.</p>

<p>The Wolf heard him, and was very angry. He stopped
short, and said to the Boy&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you think I am a coward, little Boy? You shall
rue the word. I'm brave enough to eat you, as you shall
find out this very night; for I will come and carry you
off from your home."</p>

<p>If the Wolf was no coward, at least he was a foolish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Wolf to tell the Boy if he meant to carry him off, as I
think you will agree with me.</p>

<p>The Boy went home to tell his mother. "Mother,"
said he, "a Wolf is coming to-night to carry me off."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind if he does," said the Boy's mother,
"he won't hurt you."</p>

<p>The Boy did not feel quite so sure about that, for he
had seen sharp teeth in the mouth of the Wolf. So he
chose out a big and sharp stone, and put it in his pocket.
Why he did not hide, I can't tell you, for he never told
me; but my private opinion is, he was almost as foolish
as the Wolf.</p>

<p>Well, when night came, the Boy's mother went to
bed, and she was soon snoring, but the Boy stayed up to
wait for the Wolf. About ten o'clock came a knock at
the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the Boy.</p>

<p>The Wolf opened the door, and came in, and says he,
"Now, Boy, you must come along with me."</p>

<p>"All right," says the Boy, "mother doesn't mind."</p>

<p>I have never been able to understand why his mother
did not mind, but perhaps he was a very naughty Boy,
and she was glad to get rid of him. If he did nothing
but pull his sisters' hair, and put spiders down their
necks, he was just as well out of the house, I think.</p>

<p>So the Boy got on the Wolf's back, and the Wolf
trotted off briskly to his den. Then the Wolf thought
to himself, "I have had my dinner, and I don't want any
Boy to-night. Suppose I leave him for to-morrow, and
go for a spin with my friend the Jackass."</p>

<p>So he left the Boy in his den, and off he went after
the Jackass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>What makes me think more than ever that he was a
foolish Wolf, is that he never even tied the Boy's legs
together. So when the Wolf was gone, the Boy went
out of the den, and climbed up a tree.</p>

<p>In an hour or two back came the Wolf, ready for
bed. He looked in at the mouth of the den, but
no Boy.</p>

<p>"Where on earth has that Boy got to?" said he;
"I left him here safe and sound." It never occurred
to this Wolf that legs can walk, and Boys can climb
trees. He felt very anxious, and as many people do
when their wits are puzzled, he opened his mouth
wide.</p>

<p>The Boy saw him standing at the opening of the
den, with his mouth wide open, so he pulled the sharp
stone out of his pocket, and threw it in. This Boy
was a very good shot with a stone, and the stone
went straight into the Wolf's inside, and cut his inside
so much that he died.</p>

<div class='center'>
Then the Boy climbed down from the tree, and<br />
he was at home in time for breakfast. I don't<br />
know whether his mother was pleased<br />
to see him or not; but there he was,<br />
and there he stayed, and if he<br />
has not gone away, he is<br />
there still.<br /></div>

</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was a Shepherd who
owned a multitude of goats.
Among these was one Goat,
weak and lame. You might suppose
that the shepherd took
especial care of this lame Goat,
but not he; on the contrary, he
beat him and bullied him, and
made his whole life a misery.</div>

<p>A time came when the lame Goat could stand it no
longer. So watching his chance, he gave his master
the slip, and into the forest and far away. As he
hobbled along, he trembled to think of the ferocious
beasts that the forest was full of; but even to be devoured
by an evil beast was better far than to be for
ever beaten.</p>

<p>The lame Goat made up his mind that the only way
by which he could save his life was to gain the protection
of some powerful beast. So he kept his eyes open
as he hobbled along; and, by-and-by, what should he
see but a dark cave, and at the mouth of the cave, a
Lion's footprints. Now a Lion was just the beast the
Goat wanted, for to begin with, he is the King of
Beasts, and all the other beasts fear him; and then,
too, he is a noble beast, and if he passes his word he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
will never break it. Of course, it might be that the
Lion would eat our Goat first, and ask questions afterwards;
but the Goat had to take his chance of that.</p>

<p>The upshot of it was, that the lame Goat sat down
by the Lion's den, and waited.</p>

<p>By-and-by, trippity trip, trippity trip, and up came
a Jackal. Said the Jackal to the Goat, "God bless you,
Gaffer Goat, you'll be the first food that has passed my
lips this many a day."</p>

<p>"Dear grandson," said the Goat, "God bless you
too. I'm here to be eaten, that is true enough; but I'm
meat for your betters. He whose footprints you see
here has bidden me wait until he wants me."</p>

<p>The Jackal looked at the footprints, and saw they
were a Lion's. "Aha," thought he, "let sleeping dogs
lie. If I eat the Lion's meat, the Lion will devour my
cubs." Then he went away sorrowful.</p>

<p>A little while, and trappity trap, trappity trap, up
came a Wolf. Quoth the Wolf&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well met, Nuncle Goat; you make my mouth
water. A five days' fast is sauce for the dinner."</p>

<p>"Well met, my dear nephew," says the lame Goat.
"But you had better leave me alone. I'm food for
your betters. Look upon these footprints, and let me
tell you that he who made them has bidden me wait
here until he is hungry."</p>

<p>"Oho," said the Wolf, "a Lion. Who tackles the
strong will not live long. If I eat King Lion's meat,
King Lion will make a meal of my cubs." Away went
the Wolf, trappity trap, trappity trap.</p>

<p>A little while more, and swish, swish, swish, the Lion
himself came stalking slowly along, whisking away the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
flies with his tail. When he saw the Goat sitting beside
his den, says he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friend Goat, what want you here? Are you anxious
to make a meal for me?"</p>

<p>"O King Lion," said the Goat, bowing before him
very humbly, "here I have been sitting these two hours,
and wolves and jackals came to eat me; but the sight
of your footprints was safety for me: I told them I
was yours, and they took to their heels for fear. Now
eat me if you will; for yours I am."</p>

<p>Then the Lion said, "O Goat, if you have called
yourself mine, never will I devour you. I will see to it
that you are well treated."</p>

<p>Then the Lion went out and found an Elephant,
who greeted him with the greatest respect. "Elephant,"
said the Lion, "I want you to do something for me."</p>

<p>"Speak on," said the Elephant, "do it I will."</p>

<p>The Lion said, "There is a poor lame Goat has
thrown himself on my mercy, and I have thought of
a plan by which he can be fed. If you will suffer him
to mount on your back, then while you go grazing
about, he can browse upon the young shoots of the
trees as you pass under."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea," said the Elephant, "and I'll
do it for you willingly, and indeed anything else in my
power."</p>

<div class='center'>
If the Lion was pleased at the kindness of the<br />
Elephant, more pleased was the lame Goat; and a<br />
happy life was his from that day. Never again was he<br />
beaten by a cruel goatherd: but he fed on the fat<br />
of the land, and lived to a green old age; and<br />
I hope we may be half as happy as he was.<br /></div>

<img src="images/i_076-t.png" width="114" height="150" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HERE was once a pair of Sparrows that
lived in a tree. They used to hop about
all over the place, picking up seeds or anything
they could find to eat. One day, when
they came back with their pickings, the Cock
had found some rice, and the Hen a few lentils.
They put it all in an earthen pot, and then proceeded
to cook their dinner. Then they divided the mess
into two equal parts.</div>

<p>The Cock was rather greedy, so he would not wait
while his wife put out the fire and got ready to join
in the meal. No! he gobbled up his share at once,
before she could begin.</p>

<p>When at last the poor Hen came up, her greedy
mate would not let her rest even then. "Go and get
me a drink of water," said he quite rudely.</p>

<p>She was a very kind wife, so without taking any
notice of his rudeness, off she went for the water.</p>

<p>While she was gone the Cock-sparrow's eyes fell on
his wife's share of the dinner. "Ah," thought he,
"how I should like another bit! Well, why shouldn't
I have it? A man does all the work, and women
don't want much to eat at any time." So without any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
more ado, he just set to, and gobbled up his wife's
share.</p>

<p>Back came the Hen-sparrow with a drink of water
for her husband. When he had drunk it up (and I am
afraid he forgot to say thank you), she turned round to
look for her dinner. Lo and behold! there was none.
What could have become of it? As she was wondering,
she happened to look at her husband; he looked so
guilty that there could be no manner of doubt where
her dinner was.</p>

<p>"You greedy bird," said she, "why have you eaten
my dinner?"</p>

<p>"I haven't touched your dinner," said the Cock
angrily.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you have," said she, "or you would not
look so guilty. Why, you are actually blushing." And
so indeed he was; the tip of his beak was quite
red.</p>

<p>However, he still denied it, and grew angrier and
angrier, as people do when they know they are in the
wrong. They had a terrible quarrel. At last the Hen-sparrow
said, "Well, I know a way to find out whether
you are telling lies or not. You come along with me."
And she made him go with her to the well.</p>

<p>Across the top of the well she stretched a piece of
string, and she sat on the middle of the string, and
began to chirp, "If I am telling lies, I pray I may fall
in." But though she sat there a long time, chirping
away, she did not fall in.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 172px;">
<img src="images/i_078.png" width="172" height="600" alt="In the woods" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then came the Cock-sparrow's turn. He perched
on the string and began to chirrup, "If I am telling lies,
may I fall into the well;" but hardly had he got the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
words out of his mouth, when&mdash;splash!
down he went.</p>


<p>Then the Hen was very
sorry that she had proposed
this plan; she began to weep
and cheep, and said&mdash;"Alas,
alas, why didn't I leave it
alone? What does it matter
if he eats my dinner, so long
as I have my dear husband?
Now I have killed him by my
folly."</p>

<p>Just at that moment up
came a Cat.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" said
the Cat.</p>

<p>"Cheep, cheep, cheep,"
went the Hen-sparrow. "My
husband has fallen into the
well, and I don't know how
to get him out."</p>

<p>"If I get him out," said
the Cat, "will you let me eat
him?"</p>

<p>"Of course you may," said
the Hen-sparrow.</p>

<p>So the Cat climbed down,
and pulled out the Cock-sparrow.
When she had brought
him to the edge of the well,
said she, "Now I'm going to
eat him as you promised."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, all right," said the Hen. "But stop a minute,
your mouth is dirty. I am sure you have been eating
mice. Now haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the Cat, "so I have."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Hen-sparrow, "you must get yourself
clean. We birds are clean creatures, and you must
positively wash your mouth before you begin."</p>

<p>Away went the Cat, and washed her mouth clean,
and came back again.</p>

<p>The Hen-sparrow looked at her carefully. "You
have not washed your whiskers," said she; "they are
still dirty."</p>

<p>The Cat went obediently and washed her whiskers.</p>

<div class='center'>
Meanwhile the Cock-sparrow had been sitting on the<br />
edge of the well in the sun, and by this time his feathers<br />
were quite dry. So his Hen chirped to him, "Now,<br />
dear, you can fly, let's be off." And off<br />
they flew together, and the Cat was<br />
left licking her chops and<br />
wishing she had not<br />
been such<br />
a fool.<br />

</div><div class='unindent'> <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;FISH was once flapping and
flopping on the sand by the
banks of a river. She was a
lady Fish&mdash;how she got there I
don't know; but she had been
better to stay at home, as you
shall hear. Well, she flapped
away on the sand, and couldn't
get off; she began to feel very dry. A man came
by, riding upon a horse. "O Man," shouted the
Fish, "do carry me back to the water again, or
I shall be dried up and die."</div>

<p>"No, no," said the Man, "not I, indeed! You
are a she, and I have had so much bother with shes
in my life that I shall keep clear of you."</p>

<p>"O dear good Man!" cried the Fish, "do please help
me, and I will promise not to behave badly; I'll be as
nice as any man could be. Just think! if you leave me
here, I shall dry into a stick, or somebody will come
along and eat me."</p>

<p>The Man scratched his head, and wondered what he
ought to do; but at last he took pity on the Fish, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
got down off his horse. Then he picked up the Fish
and put her on his shoulder, and walked down to the
water. "Now then," said he, "in with you."</p>

<p>"Take me into deep water," said the Fish; "this
won't do for me." So the good-natured fellow took her
and waded into the water till he was neck-deep. Then
the Fish opened her mouth wide, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now I'm going to eat you! I'll teach you to say
nasty things about women."</p>

<p>That was a nice way of showing gratitude to the Man,
wasn't it? I wonder the Man did not eat the Fish,
instead of the Fish eating him. But I am afraid the Man
was rather stupid. It never occurred to him that he
might eat the Fish, and all he did was to scratch his
head again. "That's not fair," said he; "I saved your
life, and now you want to eat me. We must find some
one to decide between us, and say which is right."</p>

<p>"All right," said the Fish; "take me up on your
shoulder again, and let us find somebody."</p>

<p>So the Man took her up on his shoulder again, and
out of the water came he. On the bank of the river
grew a Crab-apple Tree, and the Man appealed to this
Tree to decide their dispute. "O Tree," said he, "this
Fish was lying on the sand, and I saved her life, and
now she wants to eat me. Do you think that is
right?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" said the Tree&mdash;whose temper was as
crabbed as his apples&mdash;"of course! Why not? You
men are always doing mischief. Here am I, an innocent
Crab-apple Tree, and people come along and cut off my
branches to shade themselves from the sun. I call that
cool!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the Man, "they want to be cool, and
that's why they cut your branches off."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," squeaked the Crab-apple Tree;
"you know what I mean. So as you do all this damage
to us, we are right to do all we can to hurt you, and
therefore this Fish has a right to eat you if she
chooses."</p>

<p>"Come along," said the Fish, as she opened her
mouth; "jump in!"</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," said the Man, "we must try somebody
else. I feel sure there is something wrong with this judgment."
The Fish did not wish to ask anybody else, but
she had to agree, because they were on dry land.</p>

<p>So they went along until they saw an Elephant.</p>

<p>"O Elephant!" cried the Man, "do you see this Fish?
I saved her life, and now she wants to eat me. Do you
think this is right?"</p>

<p>"Right?" said the Elephant, "I should rather think
so! Why, you men are horrid brutes, always making us
carry half-a-dozen of you about on our backs, or prodding
us with a spike, or something nasty. Eat you up?
I only wish <i>I</i> could eat you up, and I would do it too,
but nature makes me eat leaves, and you are too tough
for me to digest."</p>

<p>So there was no comfort to be had from the Elephant.</p>

<p>The Fish opened her mouth wider than ever, for she
was getting hungry, and said, "Now then, look sharp&mdash;in
with you!"</p>

<p>The Man was in despair. What was he to do?
"Give me one more chance," said he, "and if they all
say the same, then you shall eat me."</p>

<p>He looked round, and not far off he saw a Jackal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
"Friend Jackal," he called out; "I say, Jackal! Stop a
minute, I want to ask you something."</p>

<p>"All right," said the Jackal, "ask away."</p>

<p>"This Fish," said the Man, "was flip-flap-flopping on
the sand and gasping for breath, and I saved her life;
and then as soon as she got safe back into the water
again, she wanted to eat me. Do you think that's
right?"</p>

<p>"Hm," said the Jackal, "I don't quite understand.
Where was the Fish?"</p>

<p>"Lying on the sand, you booby," said the Fish,
getting angry.</p>

<p>"How?" asked the Jackal.</p>

<p>"Why," said the Fish, "what does that matter, I
should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Can't understand," said the Jackal, looking stupidly
all round and then up at the sky.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Fish, angrier than ever, "all you
are asked to do, is to say whether or no I am to eat this
Man. Can't you do that without all this bother?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Jackal.</p>

<p>"Oh dear," said the Fish, "what a stupid you must be!
All right then, come along, and we'll show you." So she
made the Man take her on his shoulder again, and carry
her to the place where she had been lying on the sand.</p>

<p>"That's the place," said she.</p>

<p>The Jackal was not satisfied yet, but he must needs
see how she lay. So the Man put her down on the sand,
and the Fish began flip-flap-flopping again.</p>

<p>"Now then," said the Jackal to the Man, "up on the
horse with you, and be off! What does the Fish matter
to you? Let her die, she deserves no better."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The Man thought this a good idea, so he got up on
his horse, and off, and was more resolved than ever to
keep clear of women.</p>

<p>But the Fish was very angry at being tricked so
neatly. "You shall pay for this!" she gasped to the
Jackal; "I'll come and eat you in your den."</p>

<p>"All right, you may try," said the Jackal, "but I fancy
you will get eaten yourself." And so saying, away he
scampered.</p>

<p>The Fish flapped and flopped, until somehow or other
she managed to flap herself into the river.</p>

<p>After this the Fish used to sit by the roots of a fig-tree
which went down into the river, with her mouth
gaping, in the hope that something might fall in. The
Jackal used to come down to this place to drink, and
one day, as he was drinking, the Fish caught him tight
by the leg.</p>

<p>"Oh you silly Fish," said the Jackal, "why didn't you
catch my leg? You have got hold of the wrong thing,"
said he; "there's my leg, if you want it," pointing to the
root of the fig-tree. The foolish Fish believed she had
made a mistake, and let go the Jackal's leg, and took a
good bite of the root. The Jackal laughed, and scampered
away, crying, "Oh what a fool you are! You don't
know wood from meat!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the Fish, "next time it will be
my turn, and then we shall see. I'll come and eat you
in your den."</p>

<p>Next day, when the Jackal had gone into the forest
to find food, our friend the Fish jumped out of the
water, and went roll, roll, rolling into the forest, until
she came to the den of the Jackal; and inside the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of the Jackal's den she stood on her tail, waiting for him
to come back. By-and-by back came the Jackal, sure
enough; but Jackals are very cunning creatures, and he
came up slinking quietly, and saw the Fish before the
Fish saw him. So he called out in a loud voice, "Den,
Den!"</p>

<p>No answer. Again he called out, "Den, Den!" This
time the Fish thought that the Den was no doubt accustomed
to reply when the Jackal called to it. Perhaps it
was shy because she was present. Anyhow she thought
she had better answer, so she called out in return, "Well,
well!"</p>

<p>"You there?" asked the Jackal.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm here all right," answered the Fish.</p>

<p>"Just stop a minute," said the Jackal, "and I'll be
back directly."</p>

<p>Away he ran, and the Fish crept inside the hole, and
hid. The Jackal ran about gathering dry leaves, and
with the leaves he made a little pile at the mouth of his
hole. Then he went to a fire which some traveller had
left smouldering, and seizing a brand, he brought it and
set light to the leaves at the mouth of the cave. The fire
soon burned up.</p>

<p>"Is that nice, dear Den?" asked the Jackal.</p>

<p>"Very nice, thank you," said the Fish, who thought
she must go on pretending.</p>

<p>"I'll soon make you warm," said the Jackal, and he
piled on more fuel. It began to get very hot.</p>

<p>"That's enough now," said the Fish.</p>

<div class='center'>
"No, no, Den dear," said the cunning Jackal, laughing<br />
to himself. More and more leaves he piled on the top<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>of the fire. One side of the Fish got so hot that she<br />
turned the other. Then it got hotter and hotter, and<br />
soon the Fish expired. When the fire went out, the<br />
Jackal looked into the cave, and there was the Fish,<br />
done on both sides crisp and brown. He sat<br />
down on his haunches, and gobbled her<br />
up in a trice, and he never had a<br />
nicer dinner. That was the<br />
end of the foolish and<br />
ungrateful Fish.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp;&nbsp;SHEPHERD was feeding his flock
on the hills; and as they were
going home again in the evening,
one of the goats lagged behind.
Now, this Goat was very old, and
goats are not like men, for the
older they grow the wiser they
become. So this Goat, being very
old indeed, was also very wise. There was a very nice
clump of grass by the wayside, and the wise old Goat
said to herself, "Here is the nicest grass I have seen
for a long time. I'm not hungry, because I have been
eating all day; but I daresay I shall soon be hungry
again, so I had better eat it while I can get it." And
accordingly she set to work, and very soon she had
eaten it all up. Then she trotted off homeward.</div>

<p>As the old Goat went merrily trotting along, with
her eyes on the ground, suddenly she looked up&mdash;and
lo and behold! a huge Wolf sitting on a stump, and
staring at her hungrily! What was she to do? To
escape was impossible. She pulled her wits together,
and began&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Mr. Wolf!" cried she, "how delighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I am to see you. I have been looking for you all day,
and now I've found you at last."</p>

<p>The Wolf was so utterly astonished that he had not
a word to say at first. But after a while, he found his
tongue, and thus said he&mdash;</p>

<p>"My good Goat, you must be out of your senses.
Why, I'm accustomed to feed on goats, and here you
say you are glad to see me. Who ever heard of a
creature so foolish as to throw itself into the jaws of
death of its own free will?"</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the Goat, "you don't know my Shepherd,
that's quite clear. He is the kindest man in the
world, and he has a special weakness for you. He was
talking of you only this morning, and saying that he
owes you a good turn for not gobbling up any of his
sheep, though it is ever so long since he began to feed
them in your forest. So he has sent me to you as a
token of his esteem. I'm an old Goat, you see, and
not much use to him now. 'No <i>ifs</i> and <i>buts</i>,' says he
to me&mdash;'off with you, and let kind Mr. Wolf eat you for
his dinner.' And so here I am. And indeed, you must
not suppose I am here against my will; not at all. I
could not think of disobeying our good Shepherd. And,
if I did, he could sell me to the butcher, to have my
throat cut, and be eaten by horrid beasts of men, who
have only two legs to bless themselves with. I assure
you, I much prefer being eaten by a noble four-legged
gentleman like yourself."</p>

<p>Our Wolf was still so surprised that he could find
nothing to say; and the Goat went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not think, dear sir, that I am flattering you.
Look at me and judge if a respectable old Goat of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
age, and at the point of death&mdash;for I see you licking
your chops&mdash;whether, I say, such a one would dare to
tell lies. But, Mr. Wolf, there is one reason why I
shall be sorry to die. You may not have heard of it,
but it is true nevertheless that I am a famous songster,
and it will be indeed a pity that a gift so rare should
be lost. Will you do me one last favour, and let me
sing you a song before I die? I am sure it will delight
you, and you will enjoy eating me all the more afterwards."</p>

<p>The Wolf was very much pleased at the Goat's
politeness. "Well," said he, "since you are so kind
as to offer, I should like to hear what you can do in
the way of music."</p>

<p>"All right," said our Goat, "just sit down on that
hillock yonder, and I'll stay here; it won't sound so nice
if I am too near you."</p>

<p>The Wolf trotted off to the hillock, and sat down,
and waited for the Goat to begin her song.</p>

<p>The Goat opened her mouth, and uttered a loud
"Baa-baa-baa!"</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked the Wolf. He was rather
disappointed, but he did not say so, for fear of being
thought an ignorant lout.</p>

<p>"Oh no," said the Goat, "that was only tuning up,
to get the pitch." Then she cried again, "Baa-baa-baa,"
louder than before.</p>

<div class='center'>
Meanwhile the Shepherd was not far off, and he<br />
heard this loud Baa-baa of one of his goats. "Hullo,"<br />
thought he, "what's up, I wonder?" and set off<br />
running in the direction of the sound. Just as the<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Wolf was getting impatient, and the Goat was opening<br />
her mouth for another Baa-baa, up came the Shepherd,<br />
behind the Wolf. Thwack, thwack, thwack! came his<br />
stick on the stupid Wolf, and with a groan the Wolf<br />
turned over and died on the spot. The Shepherd<br />
and his wise old Goat trudged happily home<br />
to the sheepfold, and after that the Goat<br />
took good care to keep<br />
with the flock.<br />

<img src="images/i_073-t.png" width="151" height="150" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE once was a very learned
Bishop, who was very fond of
bird's-nesting. One day he saw a
fine large nest up in an elm-tree,
and when he had climbed up he
saw that it was full of young
Crow-chicks. One of these chicks
had such a winsome appearance,
that the Bishop put him inside his hat, and took him
home to the Palace.</div>

<p>In due time the Crow grew up, and as he heard
around him continually the Bishop and his friends
talking divinity, by degrees he became quite clever in
divinity himself. He knew all the kings of Israel and
Judah, and the cities of refuge, so that at last there was
no question in a divinity paper he could not answer.
Indeed, once when the examining Chaplain was ill, the
Crow did his work for him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>
<img src="images/i_092.png" width="345" height="600" alt="Sitting with a crow" title="" />
</div>

<p>The fame of this learned Crow spread far and wide,
until at last it reached the King's ears. Now the Bishop
had been expecting this all along, and ever since he
found the young Crow he had been training him for a
purpose. I am sorry to say he was rather a greedy man;
and as he hoped to get something out of the King by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the means of this Crow, he trained him to fly towards
anything that shone bright, such as gold and silver.</p>

<p>"When the King asks me to show off my Crow,"
he thought, "I will ask as a price anything the Crow
may choose; and then doubtless he will fly to the King's
crown, and I shall be King!"</p>

<p>At the first all fell out as he looked for. The King
sent word to say he wanted to see the Crow. He was
sitting in the garden, with his gold crown on, and all
his courtiers around him; and then asked to hear him
say all the kings of Israel and Judah.</p>

<p>"With pleasure, sire," said the Bishop; "if your
Majesty will deign to grant him what he chooses for
a reward. He has been well taught, and will not work
for nothing."</p>

<p>"By all means," said the King; "let him choose his
reward, and I will give it."</p>

<p>Then the Bishop took his Crow out of his hat, and
the Crow said all the kings of Israel and Judah quite
right, forwards and backwards, without a single mistake.
The King was delighted: he could not have done as much.</p>

<p>"And now, sire," said the Bishop, "I will let him
go, and tell him to choose his own prize."</p>

<p>So the Bishop let the Crow loose. The Crow was
flying straight for the King's crown, when all on a sudden
what should he spy but a dead cat! He turned off on
the instant, and down he swooped on the dead cat.
You know Crows eat dead things and offal; and this
Crow liked a dead cat for dinner better than a gold
crown.</p>

<p>The King laughed, the courtiers roared with merriment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bishop," said the King, when he had done laughing,
"your Crow is easily pleased, it seems! Well, he
has chosen his reward, and by my royal beard, he shall
have it. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>But the Bishop felt very rueful indeed. All his pains
and trouble lost, and nothing to show for it! He shook
his head and went away, singing to himself a little chant
he made up on the spot, all out of his own head&mdash;</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>NCE upon a time a Butcher bought a Goat;
but as he was going to kill the Goat, and
make him into meat for the table, the Goat
opened his mouth, and said&mdash;</div>

<p>"If you kill me, Butcher, you will be
a few shillings the richer; but if you spare
my life, I will repay you for your kindness."</p>

<p>This Butcher had killed many goats in
his day, but he never before heard one of
them talk. Goats can talk to each other,
as you must have heard; but most of them do not
learn English. So the Butcher thought there must be
something special about this Goat, and did not kill him.</p>

<p>The Goat felt very grateful that his life had been
spared for a few more happy summers; and when he
found himself free, the first thing he did was to go into
the forest to see if he could find some means of repaying
the Butcher's kind deed.</p>

<p>As he trotted along under the trees, stopping now
and then to crop some tender shoot that came within
reach, he met a Jackal.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Goatee," said the Jackal;
"and now I'm going to eat you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be such a fool," said the Goat. "Can't you
see I am nothing but skin and bones? Wait till I get
fat. That's why I am here, just to get fat; and when
I'm nice and fat, you may eat me and welcome."</p>

<p>The Goat was very skinny, in truth, and he pulled
in his breath to make himself look more skinny. So the
Jackal said&mdash;</p>

<p>"All right, look sharp, and be sure you look out for
me on your way back."</p>

<p>"I shan't forget, Jackal," said the Goat. "Ta ta!"</p>

<p>By-and-by he fell in with a Wolf.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the Wolf, smacking his lips; "here's
what I want. Get ready, my Goat, for I am going to
eat you."</p>

<p>"Oh, surely not," said the Goat; "a skinny old
thing like me!" He drew in his breath again, and
looked very skinny indeed. "I have come here to
fatten myself, and when I'm fat, you shall eat me if
you like."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Wolf, "you don't look like a prize
Goat, I grant you. Go along then, but look out for me
when you come back."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall look out for you!" said the Goat, and
away he trotted.</p>

<p>By-and-by he came to a church. He went into the
church, and there he saw last Sunday's collection plate,
full of gold coins. In that country, any one would have
been ashamed to put coppers into the plate, not because
they were rich, for they were not, but because they were
generous. Now, Goats are not taught that they must
not steal, but they think they have a right to whatever
they can get hold of; so this Goat opened his mouth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and licked up all the sovereigns, and hid them under
his tongue.</p>

<p>The Goat next went to a flower-shop, and asked the
man who sold the flowers to make some wreaths, and
cover him up with them, horns and all. So the man
covered him up with flowers, till he looked like a large
rose-bush. Then the Goat popped out a sovereign from
his mouth, to pay the man, and very glad the man was
to get so much for his roses.</p>

<p>Then the Goat set out on his homeward way. He
looked out for the Wolf, as he had promised to do;
and when the Wolf saw him coming along, he thought
he was a rose-bush. The Wolf was not at all surprised
to see a rose-bush walking along the road, for many
were the strange things he had seen in his life; and if
you come to think of it, this was no stranger than a
Goat that could talk English.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Rose-bush," said the Wolf; "have
you seen a Goat passing this way?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said the Goat, "I saw him a few minutes
ago back there along the road."</p>

<p>"Many thanks, Rose-bush," said the Wolf; "I am
much obliged to you," and away he ran in the direction
in which the Goat had come.</p>

<p>By-and-by he came to the Jackal.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Rose-bush!" said the Jackal. "Have you
seen a Goat anywhere as you came along?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied the Goat, out of the roses; "I
saw him just now, and he was talking to a big Wolf."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said the Jackal, "I must look
sharp, if I want some Goat to-day," and off he galloped,
in a great hurry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening he got to the Butcher's house.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the Butcher, "what have we here?"
He knew that rose-bushes could not walk, but he could
not make out what it was at all.</p>

<p>"Baa! baa!" said the Goat; "it's your grateful old
Goat, come back to pay you for your kindness." And
with these words, he spouted out all the sovereigns he
found in the church, except the one he paid to the
flower-man.</p>

<div class='center'>
The Butcher was delighted to see so many sovereigns:<br />
he asked no questions, because he thought it wiser. He<br />
took the sovereigns, and found they were enough<br />
to keep him all his life, without killing any<br />
more goats. So he lived in peace, and<br />
the Goat spent his remaining years<br />
browsing comfortably in the<br />
Butcher's paddock.<br />

</div><div class='unindent'> <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;JACKAL lived on one side of a deep river,
and on the other side were fields upon fields
of ripe melons. The Jackal was always
hungry, and he had eaten everything within
reach; so he used to sit on the river bank
and bemoan his luck. "All those ripe
melons," said he, "and nobody to eat them
but men. It is really a shame. I don't know
what Providence is doing, to treat me so scurvily."</div>

<p>Perhaps Providence knew what it was about, and
the Jackal, as you shall hear, deserved no better than
he got.</p>

<p>As he sat one day by the river, moaning and groaning,
a big Tortoise popped up his funny head out of
the water. There was a big tear in each of the Tortoise's
round eyes.</p>

<p>The Jackal stopped moaning and groaning when he
saw the Tortoise. "What's the matter, Shelly?" said
he. "Aren't you well?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you," said the Tortoise, and the
tears slowly rolled down his nose. He was going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
call the Jackal Snarly, which was the nickname the
Jackal went by; but he thought better of it, because it
would have been rather rude. All the same, he did not
like being called Shelly in that offhand way.</p>

<p>"Wife and brats all right?" asked the Jackal. "No
measles or mumps?"</p>

<p>This was also very rude of the Jackal, because a
Tortoise is sensitive about mumps. If he gets mumps
when his head is inside his shell, he can't put it out;
and if his head is outside, that is still worse, for it swells
up so that he can't get it in again.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, my wife is all right," said the
Tortoise, who was rather confused; "at least, she would
be all right if I had one, but that's just it&mdash;I can't get
a wife! Nobody will look at me! and that is my trouble,"
and two more big tears trickled down his nose.</p>

<p>At this moment an idea came into the Jackal's crafty
head. "What a pity you didn't tell me before," said
he; "I could easily have found you a wife last week,
but now she has gone to live on the other side of the
river."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it?" said the Tortoise.</p>

<p>"Honour bright," answered the Jackal; "do I look
like a person who would tell a lie?" He certainly did,
only the Tortoise was too simple to see it.</p>

<p>The Tortoise rubbed away his tears on a stump, for
he had no handkerchief, and brightened up considerably.</p>

<p>"I can carry you across, friend," said he, "if you
will jump on my back."</p>

<p>The Jackal wanted nothing better, so down he jumped
on the back of the Tortoise, and the Tortoise swam
across. When they got across, the Tortoise was quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
tired, because the Jackal was very heavy for a Tortoise
to carry.</p>

<p>A fine time the Jackal had on the further side of the
river. He ran about among the fields, and ate melons
till he was nearly bursting. Every day the Tortoise
came to the bank, asking whether the match was yet
arranged, and every day the Jackal told him that all
was going well. "You have no notion how pleased
they are," said the Jackal. "Just see how fat I am
getting. They feed me like a fighting-cock, all because
of you." It was indeed because of the Tortoise that the
Jackal was so well fed, but not as he meant it.</p>

<p>By-and-by the season of melons came to an end,
and all that the Jackal had left were cut and sold in the
market. Melons were dear that season, because the
Jackal had eaten so many of them before they could
be cut. Then the Jackal stole a white dress and a veil,
and hung them on the stump of a tree which stood near
the river side; and next day, when the Tortoise popped
his funny head out of the water, said the Jackal&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's your wife at last, old Shelly! There she
stands, dumb as a stone. Not a word will she have to
say to you till I am out of the way, because she is
too modest. Come, hurry up, Shell-fish, and take me
across."</p>

<p>The Tortoise was angry at being called a shell-fish,
because tortoises are not fish at all, and they feel insulted
if you call them so. However, he was so glad to get
a wife at last, that he said nothing, only presented his
back for the Jackal to jump on. Flop! came the Jackal,
so heavy by this time that it was all the Tortoise could
do to get him across safely. If he was tired before,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
he was nearly dead now. But he swam across at last;
and the Jackal ran off into the forest, chuckling at the
simplicity of the poor Tortoise.</p>

<p>Back went our Tortoise across the river, and climbed
up on the bank.</p>

<p>"Wife!" he called out, in a tender voice.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Again he called "Wife!" but still no answer.</p>

<p>He could not make it out a bit. He crawled up to
the stump which the Jackal had decked out in wedding
finery, and put out his flapper to touch his wife's hand:
lo and behold, it was only an old tree-stump.</p>

<p>The rage of the Tortoise knew no bounds, and he
determined to have his revenge.</p>

<p>Next day the Jackal came down to drink at the river.
The Tortoise was watching for him under water; and
while the Jackal was drinking, the Tortoise nipped his
teeth into the Jackal's leg.</p>

<p>How the Jackal did howl, to be sure! He was a
great coward, and even used to cry when his teeth were
pulled out by the dentist. So now he howled at the
top of his voice, "Let me go! Let me go!"</p>

<div class='center'>
But the Tortoise held on like grim death. He was<br />
too weak to pull the Jackal under, but he was too heavy<br />
for the Jackal to pull out; so there he bides his time.<br />
By-and-by the tide began to rise. The tide rose to the<br />
Jackal's middle, it rose to his head; and his last howls<br />
came up from underneath the water in big<br />
bubbles, which showed that the crafty<br />
Jackal would play his mean<br />
tricks never more.<br /></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 151px;">
<img src="images/i_073-t.png" width="151" height="150" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a Farmer, who
had an Ass. It was the habit of
this Ass to lift up his voice and
bray, whenever he heard the
church bells a-ringing. Now in
the country where this Farmer
lived, they used to believe that a
man's soul passes when he dies
into an animal, or something else. So this Farmer
thought that any Ass that was fond of church bells,
must have been a great saint in some former life.
Accordingly, he named his Ass St. Anthony.</div>

<p>All his life long, this Ass served the Farmer faithfully,
and earned him a great deal of money.
At last the Ass died of old age.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/i_104b.png" width="97" height="125" alt="Farmer" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Farmer was very sad and sorry
when his Ass died. "My Ass served
me faithfully," said he, "and it's only
fair he should have a good funeral."
So he sent for the undertaker, and told
him to make a big coffin, and put it on
a hearse, and buried the Ass with great
splendour. Then he shaved off every scrap of hair
from his head, as the custom was in those parts when
anybody died, and gave a funeral feast to all his relations,
and dressed himself in black.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Next time he went to the Grocer's to buy sugar, the
Grocer noticed his head shaved bare, and the black
clothes, so he knew some one must be dead, a relation
or a great friend.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to see you have lost some one," said
he; "who is it?"</p>

<p>"St. Anthony is dead," said the Farmer.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the Grocer, "and I never heard
of it. How very sad!" Thought he to himself, "I
had best have my head shaved too, or else people will
call me hard-hearted."</p>

<p>So when the Farmer had bought his sugar, and was
gone, the Grocer went to the Barber and had his head
shaved. Then he put on a black coat and necktie.</p>

<p>By-and-by a Soldier came to have a chat with his
friend the Grocer.</p>

<p>"Ods bobs!" said he, "what's the matter, man?"</p>

<p>"St. Anthony is dead," said the Grocer solemnly,
and wiped away a tear.</p>

<p>"You don't say so," said the Soldier. Off he went
straight to the Barber, and made him shave his head;
then he bought a piece of crape to tie round his left arm.</p>

<p>He told the news to all the men of his regiment,
and they all felt so much sympathy with this soldier
that they shaved their heads too.</p>

<p>Next day on parade, there was the whole regiment
shaved to a man.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" asked the General.</p>

<p>The Sergeant saluted, and told him that St. Anthony
was dead.</p>

<p>"Is he? By Jove," said the General, "then I dismiss
this parade," and off he galloped on his war-horse to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the nearest Barber, who shaved his head like the men's.
On the way back, he saw the Prime Minister going to
Court. "May I ask," said the Prime Minister suavely,
"to what untoward circumstance is due the erasure of
your capillary covering?"</p>

<p>"St. Anthony is dead," answered the General.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," said the Prime Minister, "you don't
say so. He was doubtless an ornament to the party,
and it is meet that I should testify my respect." Then
the Prime Minister too went off to get his head shaved,
and appeared before the King without a single hair.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the King; "anybody
dead, hey, hey, hey?"</p>

<p>"If it please your Majesty," said the Prime Minister,
"St. Anthony is dead."</p>

<p>"What a loss for our kingdom," said the King;
"what a loss! what a loss! Excuse me a moment,"
and away he went to get his head shaved.</p>

<p>When the Queen saw him, she wanted to know why
his head was shaved.</p>

<p>"St. Anthony is dead," answered the King.</p>

<p>"And who is St. Anthony?" asked the Queen.</p>

<p>"I don't know who he is," said the King, "a friend
of the Prime Minister's."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 110px;">
<img src="images/i_107a.png" width="110" height="125" alt="Back of his head" title="" />
</div>

<p>So the Prime Minister was asked who St. Anthony
was; and replied that he did not himself know him,
but the General spoke of him in the highest terms.
The General said that St. Anthony was not a personal
friend, but he was well known in the regiment. After
inquiry amongst the men, it was found that only one
of them could tell anything about St. Anthony, and
all he knew was that his friend the Grocer shaved his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
head in memory of him. The Grocer referred them
to the Farmer, and the Farmer was out in the fields.</p>


<p>Then the King sent a messenger on horseback to
find the Farmer and bring him to court.
The Farmer was brought into court, and
when he saw the King and the Prime
Minister and General all in mourning, he
was very much surprised. The King said
to him, "Farmer, who is St. Anthony?"</p>

<p>"If it please your Majesty, he was
my Ass."</p>

<div class='center'>
The King, and the Prime Minister, and the General<br />
felt very foolish to have gone into mourning for an<br />
Ass. They put off their black clothes, but it was not<br />
so easy to get their hair back again; and so for a<br />
month or two the King, and the Prime Minister,<br />
and the General, and all the regiment of<br />
Body Guards, went about in wigs.<br />

<div><span class='notes'><a href="#n22">[Notes]</a></span></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 151px;">
<img src="images/i_073-t.png" width="151" height="150" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a Fowler who
caught a young Parrot. He kept
the Parrot in his house, hoping
that it would pick up something to
say, but the Parrot learnt nothing
at all. Then he set to work at
teaching it; but after six months
the Parrot had only learnt to say
two things: one was "Of course," and the other was
"Certainly."</div>

<p>Seeing that his trouble was wasted, the Fowler took
him to market in a gilt cage, in order to catch the
eye of customers. He cried in a loud voice, "Who'll
buy! who'll buy! here's a Parrot which can say anything
in the world! Here's a clever Parrot who knows
what he is talking about! If you want a question
answered here's the Parrot to answer you, no matter
what it may be! Who'll buy, who'll buy?" Everybody
crowded round to see the wonderful Parrot.</p>

<p>The King happened to be passing by, and heard all
this to-do about a Parrot. Said he to the Fowler&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it really true about your Parrot?"</p>

<p>"Ask him, sire," said the Fowler.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Parrot," said the King, "do you know English?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Parrot, in a tone of scorn,
turning up his beak; as who should say, "What a
question to ask <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Can you decide knotty points of law?" the King
went on.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Parrot, with great confidence.</p>

<p>"This is the bird for me," said the King, and asked
his price. The price was a thousand pounds. The
King paid a thousand pounds to the Fowler, and
departed.</p>

<p>A big price, you will say, for a Parrot. So it was;
but the King had a reason for paying it. The Judge
of the City had just died, and the King could not find
another. Hundreds of men offered to do the work.
Some wanted too much money, more than the King
could pay; some were reasonable, but knew no law;
and the cheaper ones who professed to know everything
were all Germans, whom the King would not
have at any price. When he heard of this wise Parrot,
thought he, "Here's my Judge; he will want no wages
but sugar and chickweed, and he will take no bribes."</p>

<p>So the Parrot was made Judge, and sat on a big
throne, with a white wig and a red robe lined with
ermine.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 126px;">
<img src="images/i_110.png" width="126" height="500" alt="Parrot on perch" title="" />
</div>

<p>Next day, the Parrot was in Court, and a case came
up for judgment. It was a murder case, and when
the evidence had been heard, the pleader on the
murderer's side finished up his speech by saying, "And
now, my Lord, you must admit that my client is
innocent."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "Of course."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>


<p>Everybody thought this rather odd, because the
other side had not yet been heard; and,
besides, the man was caught in the act.
However, they held their tongues and
waited.</p>

<p>Then the prosecutor got up, and made
a long speech, at the end of which he
said, "It is no longer possible to doubt
that the prisoner at the bar is guilty.
Two witnesses saw him do the deed, and
half-a-dozen caught him just as he was
pulling the knife out of the body. I
therefore call upon you, my Lord, to
pass sentence of death."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "Certainly."</p>

<p>At this the King pricked up his ears.
The man could not be innocent of course,
and yet certainly guilty, at the same time.
So he turned to the Judge and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you go against evidence so clear,
Judge, I shall begin to suspect that you
killed the man yourself."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "Certainly."</p>

<p>You may imagine the hubbub that
arose in Court when the Judge said
this! Everybody saw that the King
had made a mistake in his Judge, and
even the King himself began to suspect
that something was wrong. So he said,
rather angrily, to the Parrot&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then it is your head ought to be chopped off."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "Of course."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
"Chop off his head, then," cried the King; and they<br />
took away the Parrot and chopped off his head<br />
without delay; and all the while he was<br />
being dragged along, he called out,<br />
"Certainly," "Certainly,"<br />
"Certainly."<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp;&nbsp;FROG and a Snake had a quarrel

deadly bite. They agreed to try it
on the next opportunity.</div>

<p>A Man came to bathe in the
pond where these two creatures
lived. The Snake bit him under
the water, while the Frog floated
on the top. "Something has bitten me!" the Man called
out to his friends.</p>

<p>"What is it?" they asked.</p>

<p>Then he saw the Frog swimming on the top of the
water. "Oh, it's only a Frog," said he. Then he went
away, and no harm came of it.</p>

<p>The next time that Man came to bathe in the pond,
the Frog bit him under the water, while the Snake swam
on the top.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said the Man, "a Snake has bitten me!"
The Man died.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Frog, "you will admit that my bite
is more poisonous than yours."</p>

<p>"I deny it altogether," said the Snake.</p>

<p>So they agreed to refer their dispute to the King of
the Snakes. The Snake King listened to their arguments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and decided in favour of the Snake, and said the Man
had died of fright.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a little Lady-Mouse
that lived in a field. She
was all alone in the world, a little
old maid, and she very much
wanted a friend. But every creature
turned up his nose at the
poor little Mouse, and not a friend
could she get; until at last a Clod
of earth took pity upon her. Then the Mouse and the
Clod became firm friends, and went about everywhere
together. The Mouse walked upon her four legs, and
the Clod rolled along like a cricket ball.</div>

<p>One day the Mouse wanted a bathe; and nothing
would serve, but the Clod must go bathe along with her.
In vain the Clod protested that she did not like water;
that she had never washed in her life; that she could
not swim: Miss Mousie would take no denial, and said
severely, that if the Clod had never washed before, it
was high time to begin. So at length the Clod was
persuaded, and into the river they went. Mousie went
in first, and the Clod rolled in afterwards; but no sooner
had the poor Clod rolled into the river, than what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Miss Mousie's horror to see her melt away in the water,
and disappear.</p>

<p>Mousie was now friendless again, and loudly complained
to the River that he had stolen away her favourite
Clod.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," the River said; "I really couldn't
help melting a thing so soft. I can't give you back your
Clod, but I will give you a Fish instead."</p>

<p>This comforted Mousie, and she took her Fish and
went home. Then she put the Fish on the top of a post,
to dry. Down swooped a big Kite, and flew away with
the Fish.</p>

<p>"O my poor Fish," wailed Miss Mousie, "to be taken
away before we had a word together." Then she went
to the Post, and demanded her Fish back again. "I
gave him to you," said Mousie, "and you are responsible
for him."</p>

<p>Said the Post, "I am very sorry that I cannot give
you back your Fish, but I will give you some Wood."</p>

<p>Mousie was grateful for this kindness on the part of
the Post. So she took a piece of Wood in exchange for
the Fish.</p>

<p>Mousie and the Wood went off to buy some sweets
at the Confectioner's. While Mousie was eating the
sweets, the Confectioner's wife burnt the Wood in the
fire.</p>

<p>Mousie finished the sweets, and when she turned
round to look for her Wood, lo and behold it was gone.
With tears in her eyes she begged the Confectioner's wife
to give her back the Wood, but the Confectioner's wife
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am very sorry I cannot give you back the Wood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
because it is burnt; but I will give you some Cakes
instead."</p>

<p>This made Miss Mousie happy again, and she took
the Cakes. Then she paid a visit to the Shepherd's pen;
and while she was talking to the Shepherd, a Goat ate
up her cakes.</p>

<p>"Give me back my Cakes, Mr. Shepherd," said Mousie,
not seeing the Cakes anywhere.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry I can't do that," answered the Shepherd,
"because I am afraid one of my goats has eaten
them; but if you like, you may have a Kid instead."</p>

<p>This was better and better. Mousie was charmed
with her Kid and led it off to the music-shop, where
she had to pay a bill. While the man was writing a
receipt to the bill, his wife killed the Kid, and began to
roast it for dinner. Mousie looked round, and wanted
to know where her Kid was?</p>

<p>"I rather think," said the Music-man, "that the nice
odour of roast meat which tickles your nostrils, comes
from that Kid. I'm sorry I can't give you the Kid back,
but you may have the best drum in my shop."</p>

<p>Mousie did not like the Drum so well as her Kid; but
needs must, and she picked out a drum, and went away
with it on her shoulder. By-and-by she came to a place
where women were beating rice, to get the grains
away from the husk. She hung up her Drum on a peg,
while she watched the women husking the rice. Bang!
flap! a woman drove her pestle right through the Drum.</p>

<p>Poor Mousie. It seemed as if her misfortunes would
never end. When she asked the woman for her Drum
again, there it was, burst. The tears ran down her
cheeks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are very sorry," the women all said, "that we
cannot give you back your Drum; but you can have a
Girl instead, if you like."</p>

<div class='center'>
This brought smiles to Miss Mousie's sad face, and<br />
she dried her tears. The women gave her a nice Girl,<br />
and Mousie took the Girl home. They set up house<br />
together, and planted a crop of corn. The corn ripened,<br />
and they went out to cut it. Miss Mouse was a<br />
wee mousie, and was quite hidden among the<br />
stalks of the corn. While the Girl was<br />
cutting the corn with a sickle, she did<br />
not see poor little Mousie, so she<br />
cut her in two, and that<br />
was the end<br />
of her.<br /><br />

<p>So the woman had to give the Jackal some of this
food. And when her husband saw it, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a small dinner you have brought me to-day!"</p>

<p>"A Jackal met me," replied his wife, "and threatened
to bite me if I gave him none."</p>

<p>"All right," said the Farmer, "to-morrow I'll settle
with that Jackal."</p>

<p>On the morrow, the Farmer's wife went after the
plough, and the Farmer dressed up in her clothes and
carried out the dinner. Again the Jackal appeared.</p>

<p>"Give me some of that," said he, "or I'll bite you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, good Mr. Jackal," said the man, "you
shall have some, only don't bite me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he set down the plate and the Jackal began
to eat.</p>

<p>"Just scratch my back, you, woman," said the Jackal,
"while I am eating my dinner."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/i_121.png" width="264" height="400" alt="Cut off jackal's tail" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, sir; yes, sir," said the man. He began gently
to tickle and scratch the back of the Jackal, and in
the middle, suddenly out
with his knife, and slish!
cut off the Jackal's tail.</p>

<p>The Jackal jumped up
and capered about. "Yow-ow-ow!"
he went, "what
has come to my tail? Oh
dear! how shall I swish
away the flies? Oh dear,
how it hurts! Yow-ow-ow!"
Away he scuttled, as fast
as his legs could carry him.</p>

<p>When he got home, all the
Jackals came round him, and
asked what had become of his
tail. The Jackal was ashamed
to have lost his tail, which was
a particularly long and fine tail;
but he pretended to like it.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said the
Jackals, "where is your tail?"</p>

<p>"I had it cut off," said the Jackal, "and good
riddance. It was always in my way. Why, I never
could sit down in comfort, and now look here!" He
sat down on the place where his tail used to be, and
looked proudly round. "Now, you try!" said he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>They all tried, and found that their tails got underneath
them when they sat, and it hurt their tails rather.</p>

<p>"We never thought of that before," said they; "we
must get rid of these things. Who cut off yours?"</p>

<p>"A kind Farmer's wife," said the first Jackal. Then
he told them where the Farmer's wife lived.</p>

<p>That evening, a knock came at the Farmer's door,
as the Farmer and his wife were sitting at tea.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said the Farmer.</p>

<p>The door opened, and in trooped a number of
Jackals. "Please, Mr. Farmer," said they, "we want you
kindly to cut off our tails."</p>

<p>"Willingly," said the Farmer; whipt out his knife,
and in a jiffy slish! slish! slish! off came the Jackals'
tails.</p>

<p>"Yow-ow-ow!" went the Jackals, capering about,
"we didn't think it would hurt!" Away they went,
and all the woods echoed that night with yowling and
howling.</p>

<p>When they all got home, they found the first Jackal
waiting for them. He laughed in their faces. "Now
we're all alike," said he, "all in the same boat."</p>

<p>"Are we?" said the other Jackals, and set on him
and tore him to pieces.</p>

<p>"Now we must have our revenge on the Farmer,"
said the Jackals when they had eaten up their friend.
So next morning they scampered off to the Farmer's
house.</p>

<p>The Farmer was out, and his wife was gathering
fuel.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Farmer," said the Jackals; "we
have come to eat the Farmer for cutting our tails off."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, poor fellow," said the Farmer's wife, "he is
dead. When he saw how it hurt you to have your tails
cut off, he just lay down on the bed, and died of grief."</p>

<p>"That's unlucky," said the Jackals.</p>

<p>"But we are preparing the funeral feast," she went
on, "you see I am now getting fuel for it. Will you
give us the pleasure of your company to dinner?"</p>

<p>"Gladly," said the Jackals; "we should like to see the
last of the poor fellow;" then they ran away.</p>

<p>At dinner-time, they all came back, and found chairs
put for them, and plates round the table, with the woman
at one end.</p>

<p>"You can sit like Christians now," said the Farmer's
wife, "so I have set you a chair apiece."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the Jackals; "that is thoughtful."</p>

<p>"But I know," the Farmer's wife went on, "what
quarrelsome creatures you are over your meat. Don't
you think I had better tie you to your chairs, and then
each will have to keep to his own plateful?"</p>

<p>"A good plan," the Jackals said, wagging their heads.
They had now no tails to wag, and they had to wag
something. So the Farmer's wife tied them tight to
their chairs.</p>

<p>"But how shall we eat?" said the Jackals, who
could not stir a paw.</p>

<p>"Oh, no fear for that, I'll feed you."</p>

<p>Then she brought out a steaming mess, and put it
in the middle of the table. All the Jackals sniffed at the
steam, and all their eyes were fixed greedily upon the
meat. They began to struggle.</p>

<p>"Softly, softly, good Jackals!" said the Farmer's
wife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>But what a surprise awaited the Jackals! They were
so intent upon watching the Farmer's wife and the meat,
that none of them heard the door open, and none of
them saw the Farmer himself creep softly in, with a
great club in his hand. The first news they had of it
was crack! crack! crack!</p>

<p>All but three of the Jackals looked round, and they
saw these three of their comrades with their heads
smashed in, lolling back in the chairs. The Farmer
held the club poised in the air; down it came crack!
on the head of the fourth Jackal. Then all the others
began yowling and struggling to get free; but in vain,
the cords held them fast, they could not stir; and in
five minutes all the Jackals lay dead on the floor.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;FOWLER was bird-catching in the jungle,
and snared a wild goose. As he was
carrying home his goose, he sat down by
a pond. In this pond lived a Tortoise,
and the Tortoise put up his nose out of
the pond to sniff the air. He saw the
Fowler and the Goose, and being a very
innocent Tortoise, he feared no harm, but
began to waddle towards them.</div>

<p>"Take care, friend!" said the Goose.
"This Fowler has caught me, and he will catch you!"</p>

<p>The Tortoise waddled into the water again. "Many
thanks, friend," said he. "One good turn deserves
another." So saying, he dived down into the pond,
and brought up a ruby.</p>

<p>"Here, Mr. Fowler," said he, "take this ruby, and
let my friend the Goose go."</p>

<p>The Fowler took the ruby, but he was very greedy,
so he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you will bring me a pair to this, I will let the
Goose go."</p>

<p>The Tortoise dived down, and brought up another
ruby. Then the Fowler let go the Goose, and said
to the Tortoise, "Now hand over that ruby."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tortoise said, "Forgive me, I have made a

see the first, and if it does not match, I will try
again."</p>

<p>The Fowler gave back the first ruby. "As I
thought," said the Tortoise. Down he dived into the
pond.</p>

<div class='center'>
The Fowler waited a good long time, but nothing<br />

<img src="images/i_127-f.png" width="154" height="155" alt="F" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>AR away in the forest was the Kingdom
of Mouseland. There was a
great city, where every Mouse had
his little house, with doors and
windows, tables and chairs, books
for the grown-up Mice, and toys
for the children; there were little
shops, where the Mice bought
clothes and food, and everything they wanted; there
was a little church where they went on Sunday, and a
reverend little Mouse in a little lawn surplice to preach
to them; there was a little palace, and in this palace
lived the little Mouse King.</div>

<p>Now it happened that a caravan passed through the
Kingdom of the Mice. Not that the men of the caravan
knew what a wonderful kingdom they were in. They
thought it was just like any other part of the forest, and
if they did happen to pass a Mouse fortress, or farmyard,
they thought them nothing but heaps of earth. Just so
if you were to fly up in a balloon, and look down on
your own house from the air, it would seem like a little
doll's-house, not fit for a child to live in. This caravan,
as I have said, was passing through Mouseland, and
encamped in part of it once to spend the night. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the Camels was very sick, and as the owner of the
Camel thought it was sure to die, he left it behind when
the caravan went away.</p>

<p>But the Camel did not die; he very soon got as well
as ever he was. And when he got well he also got
hungry; so he strode all over Mouseland, eating up the
crops of the Mice, and treading their houses down, until
at last he came to the Mouse King's park. He ate a
great many trees in the Mouse King's park, and the
Keeper went in a hurry and flurry to tell the King.</p>

<p>"O King," said he, "a mountain several miles high
has walked into your park, and is eating everything up."</p>

<p>"We must make an example of this mountain," said
the King, "or the whole earth may be moving next.
Sandy," said he to his Prime Minister, who was a Fox,
"go and fetch that mountain to me."</p>

<p>So Sandy the Prime Minister went to seek the mountain
that was eating the King's park. Next morning,
back he came, leading the Camel by his nose-string.</p>

<p>When the Camel saw how little the King of the Mice
seemed to be, he began to grunt and gurgle, and sniffed
with his funny mouth. You know a Camel has a mouth
which looks as though it had two slits in it, of the shape
of a cross; and when he wants to show his contempt
for anything he pokes out his mouth like a four-leaved
clover, and makes you feel very small. "Hullo," said
the Camel, "is this your King? I thought it was the
Lion who sent for me. I would never have come for a
speck like this." Then he turned round, and walked out
of court, and began to eat everything he came across.</p>

<p>The King was very angry, but what could he do?
He had to swallow the insult, and make the best of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
However, he determined to watch his chance of revenge;
and soon he got it. For after a few days, the Camel's
nose-string became entangled in a creeper, and he could
not get away, do what he would. Then Sandy the Fox
came by, and saw him in this plight. Imagine his joy
to see his enemy at his mercy! Off he ran, and soon
brought the King to that place. Then the King said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Camel, you despised my words, and see the result.
Your sin has found you out."</p>

<p>"O mighty King," said the Camel, quite humble now,
"indeed I confess my fault, and I pray you to forgive
me. If you will only save me, I will be your faithful
servant."</p>

<p>The Mouse King was not of a spiteful nature, and as
soon as he heard the Camel ask forgiveness his heart
grew soft. He climbed up the creeper, and gnawed
through the Camel's nose-string, and set the Camel free.</p>

<p>The Camel, I am glad to say, kept his word; and he
became a servant of the Mouse King. He was so big
and strong that he could carry loads which would have
needed thousands of Mice to carry; and by his help the
King made very strong walls and forts around his city,
so that he had no fear of enemies. When there was
nothing else to do, the Camel even blacked the Mouse
King's boots, rather than be idle.</p>

<p>So things went on for a long time. But one day
some Woodcutters came into the forest. These men
lived all together in a village of their own, and they used
to build houses of wood. When anybody wanted a
house, he told the Woodcutters, and they used to leave
their village and go into the woods. Then they cut
down the trees, and sawed them into planks, and shaped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
them into the parts of a house. When the house was
finished, they put numbers on all the parts, and took
it to pieces again, and put it on a raft; and the raft
floated down the great river to the place where the
house had been ordered. Then they put up the house
in a very short time, because you see it was all ready
made, and only had to be put together.</p>

<p>These Woodcutters, then, came and settled for a
while near the borders of Mouseland; and in the course
of their wanderings they found the stray Camel. They
promptly seized him, and carried him off.</p>

<p>When Sandy told the King what had happened, the
Mouse King was very angry indeed. He sent a detachment
of his bodyguard, armed cap-&agrave;-pie, to fetch the
Woodcutters into his presence. The bodyguard captured
two of them, and led them back bound. Then the King
demanded his Camel.</p>

<p>"Pooh, silly little Mouse," said the Woodcutters. "If
you want it, you must fetch it."</p>

<p>"I will," said the King of the Mice. "Tell your chief,
whoever he is, that I hereby declare war upon him."</p>

<p>The Woodcutters laughed, and went away.</p>

<p>Then the Mouse King gathered together all his subjects,
millions and millions of sturdy Mice; and they set
out for the village of the Woodcutters. The Woodcutters
had by this time finished their job, and they had been
paid a good round sum of money for it; and the money
was carefully put away, with all the other money they
had, in a treasury.</p>

<p>Now the Mice were not able to meet big Woodcutters
in the field, but they had their own tactics. Night and
day they burrowed under the earth. First they made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for the treasury; and though the treasury had stone
walls, they got up easily through the floor, where no
danger was expected, and one by one they carried off
every coin from the treasury, until it was as bare as the
palm of your hand. Then they got underneath all the
houses of the village; and thousands and millions of
Mice were busy all day and all night in carrying out
little baskets of earth from beneath the foundations.
Thus it happened, that very soon the Woodcutters'
village was standing on a thin shell of earth, and underneath
it was a great hole.</p>

<p>Now was the time to strike the blow. The layer of
earth was so thin, that the least shock would destroy it.
So the Mouse King wrote a letter to the Woodcutter
Chief, asking once more for his Camel, and in the letter
he hid a little packet of snuff. He put the letter in the
post, and waited.</p>

<p>Next day, as the Woodcutter Chief was sitting in his
house, the postman came to the door&mdash;Rat-tat. The
footman brought in a letter, and the Woodcutter Chief
opened it. He read it through, and laughed. Then he
waved it in the air, and said, "Let them come." As he
waved the letter in the air, all the snuff fell out of it
upon his nose. The Woodcutter gave a terrific sneeze,
Tishoo! Tishoo! The thin shell of earth could not
stand the shock; it trembled, and crumbled, and fell
in, and all the Woodcutters fell in too, and all their
village, and nothing was left of them but a big hole.</p>

<p>Then the Mouse King and his army went back to
Mouseland; and though they never got the old Camel
back (for he was swallowed up along with the Woodcutters),
yet no one ever molested Mouseland again.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp;&nbsp;BLACKBIRD and his mate lived
together on a tree. The Blackbird
used to sing very sweetly, and one
day the King heard him in passing
by, and sent a Fowler to
catch him. But the Fowler made
a mistake; he did not catch Mr.
Blackbird, who sang so sweetly,
but Mrs. Blackbird, who could hardly sing at all. However,
he did not know the difference, to look at her,
nor did the King when he got the bird; but a cage
was made for Mrs. Blackbird, and there she was kept
imprisoned.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/i_132b.png" width="165" height="100" alt="Bent over looking at blackbird" title="" />
</div>

<p>When Mr. Blackbird heard that his dear spouse
was stolen, he was very angry indeed.
He determined to get her
back, by hook or by crook. So
he got a long sharp thorn, and
tied it at his waist by a thread;
and on his head he put the half of
a walnut-shell for a helmet, and the skin of a dead frog
served for body-armour. Then he made a little kettle-drum
out of the other half of the walnut-shell; and he
beat his drum, and proclaimed war upon the King.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>As he walked along the road, beating his drum,
he met a Cat.</p>

<p>"Whither away, Mr. Blackbird?" said the Cat.</p>

<p>"To fight against the King," said Mr. Blackbird.</p>

<p>"All right," said the Cat, "I'll come with you: he
drowned my kitten."</p>

<p>"Jump into my ear, then," says Mr. Blackbird.
The Cat jumped into the Blackbird's ear, and curled
up, and went to sleep: and the Blackbird marched
along, beating his drum.</p>

<p>Some way further on, he met some Ants.</p>

<p>"Whither away, Mr. Blackbird?" said the Ants.</p>

<p>"To fight against the King," said Mr. Blackbird.</p>

<p>"All right," said the Ants, "we'll come too; he
poured hot water down our hole."</p>

<p>"Jump into my ear," said Mr. Blackbird. In they
jumped, and away went Blackbird, beating upon his
drum.</p>

<p>Next he met a Rope and a Club. They asked him,
whither away? and when they heard that he was going
to fight against the King, they jumped into his ear
also, and away he went.</p>

<p>Not far from the King's palace, Blackbird had to
cross over a River.</p>

<p>"Whither away, friend Blackbird?" asked the
River.</p>

<p>Quoth the Blackbird, "To fight against the King."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come with you," said the River.</p>

<p>"Jump into my ear," says the Blackbird.</p>

<p>Blackbird's ears were pretty full by this time, but
he found room somewhere for the River, and away
he went.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Blackbird marched along until he came to the
palace of the King. He knocked at the door, thump,
thump.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" said the Porter.</p>

<p>"General Blackbird, come to make war upon the
King, and get back his wife."</p>

<p>The Porter laughed so at the sight of General
Blackbird, with his thorn, and his frogskin, and his
drum, that he nearly fell off his chair. Then he
escorted Blackbird into the King's presence.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said the King.</p>

<p>"I want my wife," said the Blackbird, beating
upon his drum, rub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-dub-dub.</p>

<p>"You shan't have her," said the King.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Blackbird, "you must take the
consequences." Rub-a-dub-dub went the drum.</p>

<p>"Seize this insolent bird," said the King, "and shut
him up in the henhouse. I don't think there will be
much left of him in the morning."</p>

<p>The servants shut up Blackbird in the henhouse.
When all the world was asleep, Blackbird said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Come out, Pussy, from my ear,<br />
There are fowls in plenty here;<br />
Scratch them, make their feathers fly,<br />
Wring their necks until they die."<br />
</div>

<p>Out came Pussy-cat in an instant. What a confusion
there was in the henhouse. Cluck-cluck-cluck
went the hens, flying all over the place; but no use:
Pussy got them all, and scratched out their feathers,
and wrung their necks. Then she went back into
Blackbird's ear, and Blackbird went to sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>When morning came, the King said to his men,
"Go, fetch the carcass of that insolent bird, and give
the Chickens an extra bushel of corn." But when
they entered the henhouse, Blackbird was singing away
merrily on the roost, and all the fowls lay around in
heaps with their necks wrung.</p>

<p>They told the King, and an angry King was he.
"To-night," said he, "you must shut up Blackbird in
the stable." So Blackbird was shut up in the stable,
among the wild Horses.</p>

<p>At midnight, when all the world was asleep, Blackbird
said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Come out, Rope, and come out, Stick,<br />
Tie the Horses lest they kick;<br />
Beat the Horses on the head,<br />
Beat them till they fall down dead."<br />
</div>

<p>Out came Club and Rope from Blackbird's ear;
the Rope tied the horses, and the Club beat them, till
they died. Then the Rope and the Club went back
into the Blackbird's ear, and Blackbird went to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning the King said&mdash;</p>

<p>"No doubt my wild Horses have settled the business
of that Blackbird once for all. Just go and fetch
out his corpse."</p>

<p>The servants went to the wild Horses' stable. There
was Blackbird, sitting on the manger, and drumming
away on his walnut-shell; and all round lay the dead
bodies of the Horses, beaten to death.</p>

<p>If the King was angry before, he was furious now.
His horses had cost a great deal of money; and to
be tricked by a Blackbird is a poor joke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said the King, "I'll make sure work of
it to-night. He shall be put with the Elephants."</p>

<p>When night came the Blackbird was shut up in
the Elephants' shed. No sooner was all the world
quiet, than Blackbird began to sing&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Come from out my ear, you Ants,<br />
Come and sting the Elephants;<br />
Sting their trunk, and sting their head,<br />
Sting them till they fall down dead."<br />
</div>

<p>Out came a swarm of Ants from the Blackbird's
ear. They crawled up inside the Elephants' trunks,
they burrowed into the Elephants' brains, and stung
them so sharply that the Elephants all went mad,
and died.</p>

<p>Next morning, as before, the King sent for the
Blackbird's carcass; and, instead of finding his carcass,
the servants found the Blackbird rub-a-dub-dubbing
on his drum, and the dead Elephants piled
all round him.</p>

<p>This time the King was fairly desperate. "I can't
think how he does it," said he, "but I must find out.
Tie him to-night to my bed, and we'll see."</p>

<p>So that night Blackbird was tied to the King's bed.
In the middle of the night, the King (who had purposely
kept awake) heard him sing&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Come out, River, from my ear,<br />
Flow about the bedroom here;<br />
Pour yourself upon the bed,<br />
Drown the King till he is dead."<br />
</div>

<p>Out came the River, pour-pour-pouring out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Blackbird's ear. It flooded the room, it floated the
King's bed, the King began to get wet.</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, General Blackbird," said the
King, "take your wife, and begone."</p>

<div class='center'>
So Blackbird received his wife again, and they<br />
lived happily ever after.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp;&nbsp;GOAT and a Hog were great
friends, and for a long time they
lived together. But they were
poor, and one day the Goat said
to the Hog&mdash;</div>

<p>"Good-bye, friend Hog! I am
going to seek my fortune."</p>

<p>"Ugh! ugh! ugh!" said the
Hog. It was kindly meant, for that was all the ignorant
Hog could say. He intended to bid good-bye to his
friend, and to wish him good luck.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 142px;">
<img src="images/i_138b.png" width="142" height="200" alt="Goat" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Goat trotted along till he came to the nearest
town. He found a grain-shop with
nobody in it; so in went our Goat, and
ate his fill of the Grain, and whatever
he could find. Then he went into the
inner room, and sat down.</p>

<p>By-and-by the shopman came in;
his little girl was with him, and the little
girl began to cry for sugar.</p>

<p>"Go and get some out of the cupboard,"
said the shopman.</p>

<p>The little girl ran into the inner room to get the
sugar, but the Goat was there. And when the Goat saw
the little girl, he cried out, in a solemn and loud voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Little girl, go run, go run,<br />
Or your life is nearly done!<br />
And my crumpled horns I'll stick<br />
Through your little body quick!"<br />
</div>

<p>The little girl ran out shrieking. "What is it, my
dear?" said her father.</p>

<p>"A demon, father!" she said; "save me from his
crumpled horn."</p>

<p>What a terrible thing to happen in a quiet household!
The poor man did not know what to do. So he sent
for all his relations, and they advised him to try what
the parson could do.</p>

<p>So the Parson was sent for, and the Clerk, and the
Sexton, with bell, book, and candle. They lit the candle,
and opened the book (I think it was a Latin Grammar,
which they judged would be enough to scare any
demon), and rang the bell; and then the Parson, with
his heart in his boots, advanced into the room.</p>

<p>Instantly a horrid groan burst upon his ears (or so
he thought), and a deep voice said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Parson, fly! or I will poke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This my crumpled horn into you!</span><br />
You'll admit it is no joke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When you feel its point go through you!</span><br />
Sexton, dig his grave, and then<br />
Let the Clerk reply, Amen!"<br />
</div>

<p>The Parson dropt his Latin Grammar, and ran away,
nor did he stop until he was safe in his own church.</p>

<p>At this the Shopman went down on his knees, and
put his hands together, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O most respectable Demon! whoever you are, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pray you do me no harm; and I will worship you, and
offer you anything you may desire."</p>

<p>Then the Goat came majestically out, walking upon
his hind legs, with his grey beard flowing from his chin,
and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Put wreaths and jewels about my neck, and on
each of my horns, and round my paws and my tail, and
give me sweetmeats to eat, and I will do you no harm."</p>

<p>The Shopman made haste to do all this; he wreathed
the Goat with flowers, and put all his wife's jewels
upon the horns and paws, and all the jewels he could
borrow from his neighbours.</p>

<p>The Goat went home, and showed all this magnificence
to his friend the Hog. The Hog winked his
greedy little eyes, and somehow made his friend understand
that he would like some too. Then the Goat told
him how he got the things, and showed him the way
to the place.</p>

<p>So the Hog went to the same shop, and found it
empty. The Shopman and his little girl had gone out
to tell all the town what adventures they had passed
through. The Hog grubbed up all he could find to eat,
and then went and sat in the inner room.</p>

<p>Soon the Shopman and his little girl came back.
The little girl ran inside to take off her little hat, and
what does she see but a big black Hog sitting there!
The Hog remembered his lesson, and wanted to say
some terrible thing as the Goat had done; but all he
could get out was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ugh! ugh! ugh!"</p>

<p>This did not frighten the little girl at all. She ran
out to her father, saying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"O papa! there is a big black Hog inside!"</p>

<p>The Shopman got out his knife, and whetted it on
the grindstone, and then he went into the room.</p>

<p>"Ugh! ugh! ugh!" said the Hog.</p>

<div class='center'>
The Shopman said nothing, but stuck his knife into<br />
the Hog. Then there was a squealing and squalling,<br />
if you like! But in two minutes the Hog was dead,<br />
and in two hours he was skinned and cut up, and by<br />
nightfall, the Shopman and his little girl, and all<br />
their friends, were sitting round a delicious<br />
leg of roast pork, and the Sexton rang<br />
the bell for dinner, and the Parson<br />
said grace, and the Clerk<br />
said Amen.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a Banker who taught
his Parrot the speech of men. The
Parrot made such progress that he was
soon able to take part in any conversation,
and he astonished every one by his intelligence.</div>

<p>One day a Parson came by the Parrot.</p>

<p>"My respects to your Reverence," said
the Parrot.</p>

<p>The Parson looked all round him, he looked down
at his feet, he looked up into the sky; but no one
could he see who might have spoken to him. He
could not make it out; he thought it must have been
a ghost. Then the Parrot spoke again. "It was I
who saluted you," said he. The Parrot was close to
the Parson's ear, and now at length the Parson saw
him. The Parrot went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"O reverend Sir, you teach men how to get free
from the chains of their sins. May it please you to
tell me how to escape from this cage?"</p>

<p>This was a practical question, but the Parson's
advice was not usually asked on such points. He did
not know what to say.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear I can be of no use to you," said he, "but
I will consult my Solicitor."</p>

<p>The Parson went to see his Solicitor, and paid him
six and eightpence. He might have bought the Parrot,
cage and all, for half that; but, as I said, he was
not a practical man. When he told the Solicitor what
business he came about, the Solicitor said nothing at
all, but fell down in a faint.</p>

<p>"What can I have said to make him faint?" the
Parson thought. "Perhaps it is the hot weather."
He poured water over the Solicitor's face, and by-and-by
the Solicitor came to.</p>

<p>The Parson was much distressed at having thrown
away six and eightpence; but he knew it would be of
no use asking the Solicitor to give any of it back, so
he did not try. He went back to the Parrot and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dearly beloved bird, I much regret having no
information to give you which may be of use. The
fact is, no sooner did I put your question to my worthy
Solicitor, than he fell down in a dead faint."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Parrot, "many thanks, Parson."</p>

<p>The Parson went away to the parish meeting.
When he had gone, the Parrot stretched himself out
on the bottom of his cage, and shut his eyes, and
cocked up his feet in the air.</p>

<p>By-and-by the Banker came in, and saw his Parrot
lying on his back, with his feet pointing to the
sky.</p>

<p>"Poor Poll," said he, "you're dead, my pretty
Poll."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
He opened the door of the cage, and took<br />
out the bird, and laid him on the<br />
ground. Immediately the Parrot<br />
opened his wings and<br />
flew away.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'><br />NCE upon a time there was a Lion, who used
daily to devour one of the beasts of the
forest. They had to come up one after
another, when called for. At last it came to
the Hare's turn to be eaten, and he did not
want to be eaten at all. He lingered and
he dallied, and when at last he plucked up
courage to come, he was very late. The Lion,
when he saw the Hare coming, bounded
towards him. The Hare said&mdash;</div>

<p>"Uncle Lion, I know I am late, and you have
cause to be angry. But really it is not my fault.
There is another Lion in our part of the jungle, and
he says that he is master, and you are nobody. In
fact, when I showed him that I positively would come
to you he was very angry."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the Lion, roaring; "who says he is my
master? Show him to me. I'll teach him who rules
the forest."</p>

<p>"Come along then," said the Hare.</p>

<p>They went a long way, until they came to a well.
The Hare looked down into the well. "He was here
just now," said he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lion looked in, and at the bottom he saw
what looked like a Lion in the water. He shook his
mane&mdash;the other Lion shook his mane. He roared&mdash;the
echo of a roar came up from the bottom of the
well. "Let me get at him!" roared the Lion. In
he jumped&mdash;splash! Nothing more was ever heard of
that Lion, and the beasts of the forest were glad to
be left in peace. They put their heads together, and
composed a verse of poetry, which is always sung in
that forest on Sundays:&mdash;</p>

"The Hare is small, but by his wit<br />
He now has got the best of it;<br />
By folly down the Lion fell,<br />
And lost his life within the well."<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'><br />NCE upon a time an old Woman was
cooking, and she ran short of fuel.
She was so anxious to keep up her
fire, that she tore out the hairs of her
head, and threw them upon the flame
instead of fuel.</div>

<p>A Monkey came capering by, and
saw the old Woman at her fire.</p>

<p>"Old Woman," said the Monkey,
"why are you burning your hair? Do you want to
be bald?"</p>

<p>"O Monkey!" quoth the old Woman, "I have no
fuel, and my fire will go out."</p>

<p>"Shall I get you some fuel, mother?" said the
Monkey.</p>

<p>"That's like your kind heart," said the old Woman.
"Do get me some fuel, and receive an old Woman's
blessing."</p>

<p>The Monkey scampered away to the woods, and
brought back a large bundle of sticks. The old Woman
piled the dry sticks on the fire, and made a fine blaze.
She put on her cooking-plank, and made four cakes.</p>

<p>All this while, the Monkey sat on his tail, and
watched her. But when the cakes were done, and gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
forth a delightful odour, the Monkey got up on his hind
legs, and began dancing and cutting all manner of
capers round about the cakes.</p>

<p>"O Monkey," said the old Woman, "why do you
caper and dance around my cakes?"</p>

<p>"I gave you fuel," said the Monkey, "and won't you
give me a cake?"</p>

<p>It seems to me that she might have thought of that
without being asked; but she did not, so the Monkey
had to ask for it.</p>

<p>Well, the old Woman gave the Monkey one cake, and
the Monkey took his cake in high glee, and capered away.</p>

<p>On the way, he passed by the house of a Potter; and
at the door of the Potter's house sat the Potter's son,
crying his eyes out.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, little boy?" asked the Monkey.</p>

<p>"I am very hungry," whimpered the Potter's son,
"and I have nothing to eat."</p>

<p>"Will a cake be of any use?" asked the kind
Monkey.</p>

<p>The Potter's little Boy stretched out his hand, and
into his hand the Monkey put his cake. Then the
little Boy stopped crying, and ate the cake, but he forgot
to say thank you. Perhaps he had never been taught
manners, but the Monkey felt sad, because that was not
the kind of thing he was used to.</p>

<p>The Potter's little Boy then went into the shop, and
brought out four little earthenware pots, and began to
play with them. He took no more notice of the Monkey,
now that he had eaten his cake; but when the Monkey
saw these earthenware pots, he began to dance and cut
capers round them, like mad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why are you dancing round my pots?" asked
the little Boy. "Are you going to break them,
Monkey?"</p>

<p>The Monkey replied, capering about all the while&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"One old Woman, in a fix,<br />
Made me go and gather sticks;<br />
Then she gave me, for the sake<br />
Of the fuel, one sweet cake.<br />
That sweet cake to you I gave:<br />
In return, one pot I crave."<br />
</div>

<p>The Potter's little Boy was very much afraid of this
dancing and singing Monkey, and perhaps he was a
little bit ashamed of his ingratitude; so he gave the
Monkey one of his four pots.</p>

<p>Away capered the Monkey, in high glee, carrying
his pot. By-and-by he came to a place, where was a
Cowherd's wife making curds in a mortar.</p>

<p>"What an odd thing to do, Mrs. Cowherd," said the
Monkey. "Have you a fancy for making curds in a
mortar?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Cowherd's wife, "but I have nothing
better to make my curds in."</p>

<p>"Here's a pot which will do better than a mortar to
make curds in," said the Monkey, offering the pot which
he had received from the little Boy.</p>

<p>"Thank you, kind Mr. Monkey," said the Cowherd's
wife. She took the pot and made curds in it. She took
out the curds from the pot, and put them ready for
eating, and some butter beside them. The Monkey
watched her, sitting upon his tail.</p>

<p>Then the Monkey got up off his tail, and began to
dance and cut capers round the curds and the butter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why are you dancing about my butter?" said the
Cowherd's wife. "Do you want to spoil it?"</p>

<p>Then the Monkey began to sing, as he capered
about&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"One old Woman, in a fix,<br />
Made me go and gather sticks;<br />
Then she gave me, for the sake<br />
Of the fuel, one sweet cake.<br />
Potter's son ate that, and he<br />
Gave a pot instead to me.<br />
Since to you I gave that pot,<br />
Give me butter, will you not?"<br />
</div>

<p>The wife of the Cowherd was much pleased with this
song, as she was fond of music. "If your kindness,"
said she, "had not already earned the butter, your pretty
song would be worth it." Then she gave him a good
lump of butter.</p>

<p>Off went the Monkey in high glee, capering along
with the lump of butter wrapped up in a leaf. As he
went, he came to another place, where a Cowherd was
grazing his kine. The Cowherd was sitting down at that
moment, and enjoying his dinner, which consisted of a
hunk of dry bread.</p>

<p>"Why do you eat dry bread, Mr. Cowherd?" asked
the Monkey. "Are you fasting?"</p>

<p>"I am eating dry bread," quoth the Cowherd,
"because I have nothing to eat with it."</p>

<p>"What do you say to this?" said the Monkey,
cutting a caper, and offering to the Cowherd his lump
of butter, wrapped up in a leaf.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Cowherd, "prime." Not another word
said he, but spread the butter upon his dry bread, and
set to, with much relish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The Monkey sat on his tail, and watched the Cowherd
eating his meal. When the meal was eaten, up jumped
the Monkey, and began capering and dancing, hopping
and skipping, round and round the herd of kine.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Bumpkin, "what are you a-doing
that for?" The Bumpkin was so ignorant that he
thought the Monkey wanted to bewitch his cattle, and
dry up all their milk.</p>

<p>The Monkey went on with his skips and capers,
and as he capered, he sang this ditty:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"One old Woman, in a fix,<br />
Made me go and get her sticks;<br />
Then she gave me, for the sake<br />
Of the fuel, one sweet cake.<br />
Potter's son the sweet cake got,<br />
Gave me, in return, one pot.<br />
Cow-wife had the pot, and she<br />
Butter gave instead to me.<br />
This I gave to you just now:<br />
Will you give me, please, one cow?"<br />
</div>

<p>"Ah," said the Bumpkin, "'spose I must." He was
afraid of the Monkey's spells, and so he gave him
a cow.</p>

<p>Away capered the Monkey, in high glee, leading
his cow by a string. "I am indeed getting on in the
world," said he.</p>

<p>By-and-by, what should he see coming along the
road, but the King himself. The King was fastened
to the shafts of a cart, which he was slowly dragging
along; and jogging by the side of this cart was an
ox; and upon the ox sat the Queen. This King had
very simple tastes, and so had the Queen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"O King," said the Monkey, "why are you dragging
your cart with your own royal hands?"</p>

<p>"This is the reason, O Monkey!" said the King.
"My ox died in the forest, and I drag the cart because
this cart will not drag itself."</p>

<p>"Come, sire," said the Monkey, "I don't like to
see a King doing draught-work. Take this cow of
mine, and welcome."</p>

<p>"Thank you, good and faithful Monkey," said the
King. He mopped his brow, and yoked in the cow.</p>

<p>The Monkey began to dance and caper, jump and
skip, round the Queen.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, worthy Monkey?" asked
the King.</p>

<p>The Monkey began his ditty:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"One old Woman, in a fix,<br />
Made me go and gather sticks;<br />
Then she gave me, for the sake<br />
Of the fuel, one sweet cake.<br />

Cow-wife had the pot, and she<br />
Butter gave instead to me.<br />
Bumpkin ate the butter, then<br />
Paid me with this cow again.<br />
Keep the cow, but don't be mean:<br />
All I ask for, is the Queen."<br />
</div>

<p>This seemed reasonable enough, so the King gave
his Queen to the Monkey.</p>

<p>Away went the Monkey, capering along, and the
Queen walked after (you see the King could not part
with his ox as well as the Queen).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>By-and-by they came to a Man sewing a button
on to his shirt.</p>

<p>"Why, Man," said the Monkey, "why do you sew
on your own buttons?"</p>

<p>"Because my wife is dead," said the Man.</p>

<p>"Here is a nice wife for you," said the Monkey.
He gave the Queen to the Man. The Monkey then
began his capers again, but all he could find to caper
about, was a drum.</p>

<p>"You may have that drum, if you like," said the
Man. "I only kept it because its voice reminded me
of my wife, and now I have another."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you!" said the Monkey. "Now
I am rich indeed!" Then he began to beat upon the
drum, and sang:&mdash;</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>N a certain village, whose name I
know (but I think I will keep it
to myself), in this village, I say,
there was once a Milkman. I
daresay you know that a Milkman
is a man who sells milk; but
I have seen milkmen who also sell
water. That is to say, they put
water in the milk which they sell, and so they get more
money than they deserve. This was the sort of Milkman
that my story tells of; and he was worse than the more
part of such tricksters, since he actually filled his pans
only half full of milk, and the other half all water. The
people of that village were so simple and honest, that
they never dreamt their Milkman was cheating them;
and if the milk did seem thin, all they did was to shake
their heads, and say, "What a lot of water the cows do
drink this hot weather!"</div>

<p>By watering his milk, this Milkman got together a
great deal of money: ten pounds it was, all in sixpences,
because the villagers always bought sixpennyworth of
milk a day.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 234px;">
<img src="images/i_155.png" width="234" height="400" alt="Milkman" title="" />
</div>

<p>When the Milkman had got ten pounds, that is to say,
no less than four hundred silver sixpences, he thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
he would go and try his tricks in another place, where
there were more people to be cheated. So he put his
four hundred silver sixpences in a bag, and set out.</p>


<p>After travelling a while, he came to a pond. He sat
down by the pond to eat his breakfast, laying his bag
of sixpences by his side;
and after breakfast, he proceeded
to wash his hands
in the pond.</p>

<p>Now it so happened
that this was the very pond
where the Milkman came
to water his milk. He
came all this way out of
the village, because he did
not want to be seen by
the people of the village.
But there was one who
saw him; and that was a
Monkey, who lived in a
tree which overhung the
pond. Many a time and
oft had this Monkey seen
the Milkman pour water
into the milk-cans, chuckling
over the profit he was
to make. This was a very worthy and well-educated
Monkey, and he knew just as well as you or I know,
that if you sell milk, you should put no water in it.
When the Man stooped down to wash his hands in the
pond, quietly, quietly down came the Monkey, swinging
himself from branch to branch with his tail. Down he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
came to the ground, and picked up the bag of sixpences,
and then up again to his perch in the tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>
<img src="images/i_156.png" width="433" height="600" alt="Monkey in tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Monkey untied the mouth of the bag, and took
out one sixpence, and, click! dropped it into the pond.
The Milkman heard a tiny splash, but it did not trouble
him, because he thought it was a nut or something that
had fallen from the tree. Click! another sixpence.
Click! went a third.</p>

<p>By this time the Milkman's hands were dry, and he
looked round to pick up his bag, and get him gone. But
no bag! Click! click! went the sixpences all this while;
and now the Milkman began to look around him. Before
long he espied the Monkey sitting on a branch with his
beloved bag, and&mdash;O horror! dropping sixpences, click!
click! click! one after another into the pond.</p>

<p>"I say, you Monkey!" shouted he, "that's my bag!
What are you doing? bring me back my bag!"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said the Monkey, and went on dropping
the sixpences, click! click! click!</p>

<p>The Milkman wept, the Milkman tore handfuls of hair
out of his head; but the Monkey might have been made
of stone for all the notice he took of the Milkman.</p>

<p>At last the Monkey had dropt two hundred sixpences
into the pond. Then he tied up the mouth of the
money-bag, and threw it down to the Milkman. "There,
take your money," said the Monkey.</p>

<p>"And where's the rest of my money?" asked the
Milkman, fuming with rage.</p>

<p>"You have all the money that is yours," said the
Monkey. "Half of the money was the price of water
from this pond, so to the pond I gave it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<div class='center'>
The Milkman felt very much ashamed of himself, and<br />
went away, a sadder but a wiser man; and never again<br />
did he put water in his milk. And that is why<br />
I have not told you the name of the village<br />
where he lived; for now that he has<br />
turned over a new leaf, it would<br />
hardly be fair to rake up<br />
his old misdeeds<br />
against him.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'>NDER a certain tree lived a wild Bull, and a
Bullfinch had his nest in the branches. A Bull
in a field is vicious enough, as I daresay you
know; but a wild Bull is worse than anything.
Wild Bulls are tremendously strong, and they
can fight with almost any beast of the forest,
even Lions and Tigers.</div>

<p>This wild Bull used to attack every creature that
came near; and that, not for the sake of food, as Lions
and Tigers do, but out of pure mischief. When the
creature (were he man or beast) was killed, this wild
Bull would leave the corpse lying, and begin to eat
grass. But the little Bullfinch harmed nobody, unless
it were a worm he would eat now and again for a
treat. All day long he hopped about, picking up seeds,
and singing away with all his throat. Many a time
he saw the wild Bull gore some creature to death;
and when he saw such things, tears would roll out of
his eyes, because he could do nothing to help.</p>

<p>At last he thought to himself that he could at least
warn the wild Bull of his wickedness, and clear his
own conscience. So one morning, when the wild Bull
was sitting under his tree, and looking around him,
Bullfinch piped up, and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good brother Bull, I suppose we are akin somehow
or other, because of our names."</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay it may be so, Cousin Bullfinch," said
the Bull.</p>

<p>"Well," says the Bullfinch, "allow me the right of
a near kinsman to say something to you."</p>

<p>"All right, go ahead," said the Bull gruffly.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Bullfinch, clearing his throat (for
he was a little frightened), "don't you know that murder
is a very evil deed, and yet you do it every day of
your life?"</p>

<p>"Impertinent speck!" said the Bull, getting up and
walking away. He thought it cheeky that a bird so
little should presume to rebuke a great big Bull. He
did not remember, you see, that big bodies are often
big fools, and precious goods are done up in small
parcels. The warning of the little Finch was as the
blowing of the wind; at least, so it seemed at the
time, though afterwards (as you shall hear) the Bull
did remember it.</p>

<p>So the Bull went on tossing and goring all that
came within reach; and now he would have nothing
to say to the poor little Bullfinch.</p>

<p>This went on, until one night a certain Lion had
a dream. This Lion was King of the Forest, and he
could conquer any creature who fought with him. In
his dream the Lion thought that an angel stood before
him, and said: "O Lion! in such a place, under a tree,
lives a wild Bull, who does cruel murders every day
upon innocent folk. By that tree is good pasture, and
the wild Bull has grown very fat. I think he would
make a nice meal for you; and at the same time you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
would be doing a good action in ridding the world of
such a monster."</p>

<p>When day dawned, the Lion made no delay, but
set out at once towards the place of the wild Bull.
By-and-by he caught scent of the Bull, and then he
uttered a terrible roar. The Bull heard the roar and
was afraid; and still more feared he, when he saw
this Lion approach, whom he knew to be the King of
the Forest, and invincible.</p>

<p>"O Bull!" roared the Lion, "your hour has come.
I am come to eat you, as a just punishment for your
sins, and also because I am hungry."</p>

<p>At this the Bull trembled greatly, for he knew now
that his sins had found him out. His knees gave way
beneath him, and he was just about to sink to the
ground, when the words of the Bullfinch came into
his mind. Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O mighty Lion! I have indeed deserved to be
eaten, but I beg of you one last favour. Give me
leave to bid farewell to a little kinsman of mine, Cousin
Bullfinch, who lives in this tree, and at this moment is
picking up seeds not far off."</p>

<p>The Lion was a good fellow, and had no wish to
be hard on the Bull, so he said: "I give leave, O Bull,
if you will promise on your honour to come back and
be eaten."</p>

<p>The Bull gave his word that he would come back,
and then went slowly away in search of the Bullfinch.</p>

<p>Master Bullfinch was at the moment eating his frugal
breakfast of seeds. Suddenly he was aware that the wild
Bull was approaching. He looked up, and seeing the
dejected air of the Bull, he greeted him as cheerfully as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he could, and then asked what the matter was? This
Bullfinch bore no manner of grudge for the Bull's rudeness,
because in his little body was a great heart, and he
never thought of mean things.</p>

<p>"O Finchy, Finchy!" moaned the Bull, "look
upon me for the last time! A hungry Lion has come
to devour me, and it is of no use to resist; for he
says that an angel has sent him to punish me for
my sins."</p>

<p>"Poor old chap!" said the Bullfinch, "tell me all
about it."</p>

<p>Then the wild Bull told him the dream which the
Lion had seen.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Bullfinch, "that is curious."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the Bull.</p>

<p>"Because," said the Bullfinch, "I too had a dream
last night, which I think the Lion ought to hear."</p>

<p>The wild Bull was not interested in the Bullfinch's
dream; would you be interested in dreams, I wonder,
if you expected to be eaten the next minute? However,
he said nothing; and when Bullfinch fluttered his wings,
and flew away towards the Lion, our friend the wild Bull
followed slowly behind.</p>

<p>"Good morning, King Lion," said the little bird. "So
you have had a dream?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Lion, and then he told the Bullfinch
his dream.</p>

<p>"I had a dream too," said the Bullfinch, "and this it
was. I dreamt that the same angel who came to you,
came afterwards to me, and said, 'O Bullfinch! when
the Lion comes to eat your friend the Bull, tell him
that he was sent not to destroy, but to cure; and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
now the Bull repents of his evil ways, the Lion may go
back again to his forest.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" said the Lion. "I am hungry,
it is true, but I daresay I can find some other creature,
who has committed no sins, and wants no curing. So
good-bye, friend Bull, and don't do it again." So saying,
the Lion shook hands with both of them, and went to
look for a fawn.</p>

<div class='center'>
Then the Bull, wild no longer, thanked his friend the<br />
Bullfinch for saving his life, and they became faster<br />
friends than ever. The Bull gored no more creatures,<br />
indeed he welcomed them as his guests; and in the fat<br />
pastures around that tree you might have seen, if you<br />
had been there, whole herds of deer and antelopes<br />
grazing without any fear; and the Bull lived<br />
in their midst to a green old age, till<br />
he died respected and went<br />
to a happier world.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'>NCE upon a time, two Swans had to leave
home on account of a famine; and they
settled by a lake in a distant land. By the
side of this lake lived a Carrion Crow. The
Swans built a nest, and Mrs. Swan laid two
beautiful round eggs in the nest, and sat upon
them. She had to sit on the eggs for weeks,
in order to keep them warm, so that the little
ones might grow up inside and be hatched.
While she sat there, the Crow used to help Mr. Swan
to find food for his wife; and when the cygnets came
out of their shells, the Crow helped to feed them also.</div>

<p>So all went happily for a time, and Mr. and Mrs.
Swan were deeply grateful to the kind Crow. But
Crows are not kind without some reason, and what this
Crow's reason was, you shall now hear.</p>

<p>Time went on, and one day Mr. Swan said to Mrs.
Swan&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear, the famine must be over by this time.
What do you say? shall we go home again?"</p>

<p>"I am ready," Mrs. Swan said, "and we can start
to-morrow if you like."</p>

<p>"Stop a bit," says Mr. Crow, "I have a word or two
to say first."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" the Swans said, both
together.</p>

<p>"I mean," said the Crow, "that you may go, if you
like, but these cygnets are as much mine as yours, and
may I be plucked if I let them go with you!"</p>

<p>"Yours!" said Mrs. Swan. "Who laid the eggs?
who hatched them?"</p>

<p>"And who fed them, I should like to ask?" said the
Crow, with a disagreeable laugh: "Caw, caw, caw!"</p>

<p>Here was a bolt from the blue! The Crow stuck to
it, and the end of all was, that Mrs. Swan stayed behind
to look after her little ones, while Mr. Swan flew off to
lay a complaint in court against the greedy Crow.</p>

<p>But you must not suppose that this Crow meant to
sit still, and let the Swan have things all his own way.
Not he; off he flew secretly to the Judge, and to the
Judge said he&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Judge, a Swan is going to lodge a false charge
against me, and I want your help!"</p>

<p>"If it is false," said the Judge, "you want help from
no one."</p>

<p>"Caw, caw, caw!" said the Crow, "you understand
me." Then this vulgar Crow winked one eye at the Judge.</p>

<p>"Hm, hm," said the Judge, looking at the Crow. It
is a pity to say it, but it is quite true, that this Judge was
an unjust Judge; and he was ready to give any decision,
right or wrong, so long as he was bribed well for his
trouble. In that country, you see, there was no jury to
decide matters, but all power lay in the hands of the
Judge.</p>

<p>The Judge winked one eye at the Crow. Then he
said, very softly, "<small>What will you give me?</small>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Silver and gold have I none," said the Crow, "but
I'll tell you what I will do. I'll carry your father's bones
to the Holy Land, and bury them in Jerusalem, and
then your father will be sure to go to heaven."</p>

<p>The Judge was so foolish that he really believed his
father would go to heaven at once, if only his bones
were buried in Jerusalem, although his father had been
as wicked as himself while he was alive. So he agreed
to the Crow's proposal.</p>

<p>When the case came into court, of course the Judge
gave decision in favour of the Crow, though there was
no evidence on his side except his own word: and who
but a fool would trust the word of a Carrion Crow?
When the court rose, the Crow flew to the house of the
Judge, and asked for the bones of the Judge's father.
So the Judge tied up his father's bones in a bag, and
hung the bag round the Crow's neck. Away flew the
Crow, but he didn't fly far; for as the Judge watched
him, the Crow hovered over a filthy drain; and untying
the bag, began dropping the bones one by one into
the mud.</p>

<p>"Hi, you brute!" shouted the Judge, "what are you
doing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you pumpkin!" said the Crow, "did you verily
think that I should take the trouble to carry your father's
rotten old bones to Jerusalem? No, no; I only wanted
to see what rogues the race of Judges can be. Caw!"
Flop! went the last bone into the mud, and away flew
the Crow, and never came back there any more.</p>

<img src="images/i_168.png" width="439" height="600" alt="Talking to the crow" title="" />
</div>

<div class='center'><br />
So the Judge had to pick his father's bones out of<br />
the gutter. And the next thing he had to do was to<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>reverse his own decision, and give the Swan his<br />
young ones again; because, you see, a great many<br />
people had heard what the Crow said to the Judge,<br />
and knew (if they didn't know it before) that the<br />
Judge was a rogue. So the Swan got his young ones<br />
back, and as for the Judge, he became the<br />
laughing-stock of the whole city, and he<br />
was obliged to go and try his<br />
tricks elsewhere.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was once a great drought in the
land. For weeks and months not a drop
of rain fell; and the sun beat down, and
dried up the whole country, so that there
was no water to be found. Now there
was a certain pond in that country; and
as day after day the sun blazed, the water
sank lower and lower, until it was hardly
an inch deep. Numbers of Frogs used to live in this
pond; but as the water dried the Frogs died, so that
the dry mud on the banks of the pond was covered all
over with dead bodies of Frogs.</div>

<p>There came a Jackal out of the forest. He was
glad to see this pool, because the pool where he used
to drink had been quite dried up. So he made a little
platform of mud, and stuck up four posts at the
four corners; and then he gathered bundles of dry
grass, and put them upon the top of the four posts for
a thatch. Then his eye fell on the corpses of Frogs
lying about; and being a foolish animal, he thought
these corpses were uncommonly pretty. And what
do you think he did? He gathered a lot of the dead
Frogs and hung a fringe of them all round the thatch;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and in each of his ears he hung a dead Frog, like an
earring.</p>

<p>From far and near swarms of Rats used to come
to this pond for drinking, since it was the only water
to be found for a long distance, and all the rest was
dried up. Then the Jackal kept guard over the pool;
and not a drop might any Rat so much as taste, unless
he would first bow down and worship the Jackal, and
sing the following psalm, which the Jackal made up
himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A temple all of gold I found,<br />
With golden lamps hung all around;<br />
And see! the God himself is here,<br />
With two big pearls in either ear."<br />
</div>

<p>Even a Rat can tell a dead Frog from a pearl, but
willy nilly he needs must sing it, or else no water. So
when the Rat had sung this psalm, and bowed himself
down three times before the Jackal, worshipping him
as if he were a God, he was allowed to go down and
take a sip of the water.</p>

<p>One day, what should come down to the water to
drink but an Ox with one eye.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! one-eyed Ox!" screamed the Jackal,
"not a drop till you sing your psalm."</p>

<p>The Ox blinked his one eye stupidly, and looked
round. "What psalm?" asked the one-eyed Ox.</p>

<p>"Mine," said the Jackal, who was very proud of
his psalm, "my own composition." Then he sang it
over to the Ox, that he might hear it.</p>

<div class='center'>
"'A temple all of gold I found&mdash;'<br />
</div>

<p>"That's this, you know," he explained, pointing to
the scraggy thatch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A temple all of gold I found,<br />
With golden lamps hung all around;<br />
And see! the God himself is here,<br />
With two big pearls in either ear."<br />
</div>

<p>"Ah," said the one-eyed Ox, "I'm rather stupid,
I fear, and it will take me a minute or two to learn
that psalm. It's a mighty fine psalm, that; I never
heard the like in church. Suppose I say it over to
myself while I'm a-drinking? that will save time, and
it would be a thousand pities to spoil a thing like that."</p>

<p>This flattered the Jackal so much that he agreed.</p>

<p>One-eye went down to the pool, and took a long,
long pull at the water. Then he came out of the
water, and went slowly up to the Jackal, as he was
sitting under his thatch, with its string of dead Frogs,
and the two Frogs in the Jackal's ears.</p>

<p>"Now then, booby!" the Jackal said, "look sharp,
the God is waiting."</p>

<p>The Ox opened a big mouth, and in a very hoarse
voice he sang&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A nasty dirty thatch I found,<br />
With dried-up Frogs hung all around;<br />
And see! the mangy Jackal here,<br />
With two dead Frogs in either ear."<br />
</div>

<p>You may imagine the rage of the Jackal to hear
this! He fairly foamed at the mouth. "You blasphemous
beast!" screamed he, "I'll teach you to
abuse a God!" And with that he jumped down off
his seat, and gave chase.</p>

<p>Away scuttled the Ox; and as he ran, the water
he had been drinking went gurgling inside him, flippity-flop,
flippity-flop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>This sound rather frightened the Jackal. "What's
that?" he cried.</p>

<p>"A dog at your heels," said the Ox.</p>

<div class='center'>
The Jackal was so scared at the very name of dog,<br />
that he turned about in no time, blind with terror,<br />
and away he scampered as hard as he could pelt.<br />
He was so frightened, that he did not see where<br />
he was going; so he ran straight into<br />
the midst of a pack of hounds, who<br />
made short work of the<br />
conceited Jackal.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp;&nbsp;NANNY-GOAT and a Tigress were near
neighbours in a certain wood, and fast
friends to boot. The Tigress had two tiger-cubs;
and the family of the Nanny-goat were
four frolicksome kids, named Roley, Poley,
Skipster, and Jumpster.</div>

<p>But the Tigress was jealous of her friend
the Nanny-goat, because Nanny had four
young ones, while she had only two. One day, as she
was musing on the injustice of her fate, she thought
to herself, "What if I eat up two of Nanny's kids, and
then things will be equal? They do say, friends have
all things in common." So to Nanny-goat she hied, and
said she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sister Nanny, my little ones have gone out, and
I am very lonely at home. Do let one of your dear
kiddies come and sleep with me, for company. Will
you, please?"</p>

<p>"Gladly will I, sister," said honest Nanny-goat,
thinking no evil of her friend. Then she ran out to
the fields, where Roley and Poley were rolling over
each other, and Jumpster was jumping over the back
of Skipster.</p>

<p>"Children, children!" said Nanny-goat, "a treat for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
you! A kind friend has asked one of you out to spend
the night."</p>

<p>"Baa baa baa!" cried the Kids, running up; and
then three of them called out all together, dancing
about old Nanny, "Let me go! Let me go! Let me
go!" But the fourth, who was a wise little imp (and
Roley it was, to be sure), asked in a quiet tone, "Who
is it, Mammy Nanny-goat?"</p>

<p>"Why, who should it be but your Aunt Yellowstripe?"
said Nanny.</p>

<p>At this they all looked rather crestfallen; for although
Nanny-goat loved her friend dearly, all the youngsters
were afraid of her, for what reason they could not say.
Children have a way of finding out their friends; and
these Kids had noticed at times a gleam in the eyes of
Auntie Yellowstripe, which boded ill to little Kids.</p>

<p>"No-o, thank you, Mammy Nanny-goat," said Skipster,
skipping away.</p>

<p>"No-o-o, thank you, Mammy," said Jumpster, and
jumped after her.</p>

<p>"No-o-o-o, thank you," said Poley, and rolled away
by himself.</p>

<p>Why did Poley roll away by himself? Because
Roley stayed behind. Roley did not say No, thank
you; on the contrary, he said Yes. Why Roley said
yes instead of no, was his own concern; and I think
Roley knew what he was about.</p>

<p>This was how Roley went with the Tigress; and that
night the Tigress put him to sleep by her side. She
cuddled him up, and made a great fuss of him, thinking
to herself, "Soft words cost nothing; and when he is
fast asleep, we shall see what we shall see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>But Roley was no such fool as the Tigress thought
him. So he did not go to sleep, but only pretended;
and no sooner did Dame Yellowstripe begin to snore,
than up jumps Roley, as soft as you please, and fetches
out one of Yellowstripe's own cubs, who were sleeping
away at the back of the cave. He laid the cub in his
own place, and went into the corner to sleep with the
other cub.</p>

<p>About midnight the Tigress awoke, and as she felt
the warm little thing nestling beside her, she chuckled
to herself. Then she gave him one tap with her mighty
paw; crack! went his neck, and his dancing days were
over; the Tigress gobbled him up, skin, bones, and
teeth. It was pitch dark, you know, and she could not
see that she was eating her own cub. "One less of the
brood now," thought the Tigress; turned over, and went
to sleep again.</p>

<p>Next morning, they all woke up; and Yellowstripe,
to her dismay, saw that Roley was rolling about, right
as a trivet. She looked round for her own cubs, and lo
and behold! one was missing. At first she could not
make it out in the least; but when it dawned upon her
what had happened, she nearly turned yellow all over
with rage and disappointment.</p>

<p>"Did you have a good night, Roley dear?" said she
in a wheedling tone to the Kid.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Auntie," said the little Kid, "only a gnat
bit me."</p>

<p>This astonished the Tigress, who thought that the
Kid must be stronger than he appeared to be. "Never
mind," said she to herself; "come to-night, we shall see
what we shall see."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>That night all went as before; only this time Roley
put a huge stone in his place, and then he ran off as fast
as his legs could carry him. When the Tigress awoke,
she gave a pat to the stone: it hurt her paw sadly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens," said she, "what a mighty Kid it is,
to be sure! I must make short work of him now I have
the chance, or there is no knowing what may happen.
When he grows up, he may kill me." So she gave a
fierce bite at the stone, and broke all her front teeth.</p>

<p>Now the Tigress' fury knew no bounds. She went
raging about the cave, hunting in every corner for Roley;
but Roley was not to be found, because, as I have told
you, he was not there. So the Tigress was forced to
wait until morning for her revenge.</p>

<p>All night long the Tigress lay awake with the pain
of her teeth; and when morning came, she sought out
a familiar friend to take counsel with. This friend was
an old one-eyed Tiger. The Tigress and the one-eyed
Tiger talked for a long time together, and as they talked
they walked. When they came to the end of their talk,
their walk was also at an end, and they found themselves
at the mouth of Yellowstripe's den. There in the den,
as calm as you please, playing with the one remaining
Tiger cub, was Roley.</p>

<p>"Ha ha," laughed One-eye, "so there you are. Let
us sit down, and I will tell you a story."</p>

<p>"Do, do, Nuncle One-eye," cried Roley.</p>

<p>So they all sat down, and One-eye began. "When
I eat little Kids," said One-eye, "four of them make me
a mouthful; and I'm coming one of these days to make
one mouthful of you and your brother and sisters."</p>

<p>"Capital, capital, Nuncle One-eye!" said Roley,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
clapping his paws; "what good stories you do tell,
Nuncle One-eye! Now I'll tell you a story. When
you come to eat us up, Skipster will hold you by the
forelegs, and Jumpster will hold you by the hind legs,
and Poley will hold your head, and Roley will chop
it off, if only mother will give us a light."</p>

<p>This terrified One-eye extremely, for he was a great
coward. He thought it all as true as gospel, so he took
to his heels, and left Yellowstripe in the lurch.</p>

<p>On the way, he met six other Tigers, friends of his.
"Oh my friends!" said he, "I have such a treat for you!
A fine fat Kid, crying out to be killed! Come along,
come along, I'll show you the way, and all I ask is the
pleasure of serving you." Cunning old One-eye!</p>

<p>The six Tigers believed all that One-eye said, and
away they all trotted together towards the place where
Roley lived. They knew he would go home sooner or
later; and indeed he was there already, and saw them
coming, so he climbed up a tree. Goats are wonderfully
good at climbing rocks, but I think most of them cannot
climb trees; still, whatever may be true of other goats,
Roley could. If it were not so, this story would never
have been written. So Roley climbed up a tree, and sat
on a branch, with his legs all dangling in the air.</p>

<p>The first Tiger gave a jump, and missed him. Number
two gave a jump, and missed him. They all jumped, one
after another, and not one of them could touch Roley;
who sat and laughed at them so heartily, that he nearly
fell off his perch.</p>

<p>At last, when they were tired of jumping, and jumping,
up gets old One-eye, and says, "I know how to get at
him. I'll stand here, and you get on my back, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the rest of you one a-top of another, and then we shall
catch him nicely." They all thought this an excellent
idea; so One-eye propped his old carcass against the
tree, and the other Tigers mounted one on another's
shoulders, until there they were, all seven in a pyramid.
Then the topmost Tiger stretched out his paw, and all
but got hold of Roley.</p>

<p>Thereupon One-eye cocked up his solitary eye, to see
how things were going on up aloft; and seeing this,
Roley called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, give me a lump of mud, and I'll hit the
brute in his sound eye, and then we will finish him off."</p>

<div class='center'>
When One-eye heard this, he gave a great start, and<br />
down toppled the whole seven in a heap, one a-top of<br />
the next, spitting and roaring and scratching. They<br />
were so much taken aback, that they imagined all sorts<br />
of powerful beasts to be fighting with them, when it was<br />
only their own selves, biting each other; and the<br />
end of all was, that as soon as the seven Tigers<br />
had each got his four legs to himself, off<br />
they went helter-skelter into the forest,<br />
and never more troubled Mammy<br />
Nanny-goat and her four<br />
frolicsome<br />
Kids.<br /></div>

<div><span class='notes'><a href="#n38">[Notes]</a></span></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/i_181-o.png" width="175" height="250" alt="O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>NCE upon a time there was a Stag living in
a certain jungle, and in the same jungle lived
a Crow. These two were bosom friends.
Why a Stag should take a fancy to a
Crow, I cannot say; but so it was;
and if you do not believe it, you had
better not read any further.</div>

<p>It so befell that a Jackal came by
one day, and his eye fell on this Stag,
and a fine plump Stag he was. The Jackal's
mouth began to water. How he would like
to make a meal of so dainty a piece of flesh. But he
knew it was of no use trying to attack the Stag, who
seemed very strong. Still, by hook or by crook, that
Stag he would have. So in the depths of his cunning
heart he concocted a trick, of which you shall shortly
hear.</p>

<p>The Jackal watched his chance, and as soon as he
had found the Stag alone, he began to say, sidling up
to the Stag, and whispering in his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beware of that Crow; he's fooling thee. Beware,
beware all birds of the air. There's no trusting any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
bird, let alone a Crow, who is worst of the whole
feathered tribe. Now you and I, who never try in
the air to fly, good honest gentlemen with four legs
apiece, we are marked out for friends by Nature
herself."</p>

<p>Will you be surprised to hear that the Stag listened
to the crafty and slanderous words, and deserted his
friend the Crow? When your hair is grey you will
know that such is the way of the world, and that a
true friend who sticks to the end, is harder to find
than a diamond mine.</p>

<p>But although this Stag was shallow-hearted and
weak, not so the Crow. He was a true friend, and
he was cut to the heart by the unkindness of his friend
the Stag; but he wasted no time in fruitless tears. He
went about his work as usual, and waited for a chance
of winning back his recreant friend.</p>

<p>Well, Stag and Jackal scoured about the woods
together, and the Jackal did his best to make himself
agreeable. In this he had poor success; for though
the Stag tried hard to like his new comrade, yet he
could not help seeing that he was dirty; moreover,
the Jackal ate all sorts of dead animals, but the Stag
was a vegetarian, and did not approve of this kind of
food. But though the Stag had qualms now and again,
he was not strong enough to break loose from the
friendship of the Jackal.</p>

<p>But the time was ripening for the Jackal's blow.
He knew a place where huntsmen used to set gins
and snares, to catch the wild animals. So one day,
as he and the Stag were out a-walking together, the
Jackal so managed that they passed by this place. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Jackal took good care to keep clear of the snare; but
the innocent Stag knew nothing of snares or gins, so
into a snare he stept, and snap! he was fast.</p>

<p>Now was the time for a true friend to show his
friendship. But the Jackal, as we already know, was
a humbug; accordingly, all he did was to sit by the
side of the Stag, and try not to look pleased.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, what shall I do?" said the Stag, when
he found himself caught. "Oh my friend, do help
me out."</p>

<p>"You shock me, friend," said the Jackal, pulling a
long face; "surely you have not forgotten that it is
Sunday? We are told in the Ten Commandments to
do no work on the Sabbath day. If it were not so,
how gladly would I help you!" So saying, he wiped
away a crocodile tear. He sat down and waited in
the hope that the Stag would die, and then he would
eat him.</p>

<p>But the faithful Crow was not far. Though his friend
the Stag would not so much as cast him a look, the
Crow followed him ever, biding his time; and now the
time had come.</p>

<p>The Crow perched on a neighbouring tree, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear friend, I am only a weak little bird, and I
cannot help you; but I can teach you to help yourself.
My advice is, pretend to be dead, and when
the Hunter comes, he will open the snare without
any care, and you can escape."</p>

<p>"Thank you, long-suffering friend!" said the
Stag; and so he did. When the Huntsman came,
he thought the Stag was dead; he opened the snare,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and before he was aware, the Stag was up and off
and away.</p>

<div class='center'>
The Stag asked his friend the Crow to forgive<br />
him, and they lived happily together as<br />
before. As for the treacherous<br />
Jackal, he never came<br />
near them more.<br /><br />

</div><div class='unindent'>N a certain land, a flock of Crows
built their nests in the branches of
a huge cotton-tree.</div>

<p>In that country, the climate is
not the least like ours. It is hot
all the year round, and for eight
months the sun blazes like a fiery
furnace, so that the people who
live there are burnt as black as your boot; then after
eight months comes the rain, and the rain comes down
in bucketsful, with lightning fit to blind you, and thunder
enough to crack your head. These Crows were quite
happy in their nests, whatever happened; for when it
was hot, the leaves of the trees sheltered them from
the sun, and in the rainy season the leaves kept them
pretty dry.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 185px;">
<img src="images/i_186.png" width="185" height="600" alt="Monkey and crows" title="" />
</div>

<p>One evening there came a terrible storm, with
torrents of rain like Noah's flood. In the midst of it,
the Crows noticed a Monkey sliding along, drenched
and draggle-tailed, looking like a drowned Rat. The
Crows set up a chorus of caws, and called out&mdash;</p>
<p>"O Monkey, what a fool you must be! Look at
us, dry and comfortable, in our nests of rags and twigs.
If we, with only our little beaks to help us, can make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
comfortable nests, why can't
you, with two hands and two
feet and a tail?"</p>



<p>You might have thought the
Monkey would take this advice
to heart. But not a bit of it.
Monkeys are naturally a lazy
tribe, and they are full of envy,
hatred, and malice. What they
like best is destroying whatever
they can lay their hands on;
and when I look upon some
of the nations of this globe, I
cannot help thinking that they
really must be descended from
Monkeys. So this Monkey snapt
and snarled, and said to the
Crows&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just wait till morning, and
then we'll see what a Monkey
can do."</p>

<p>The simple birds were delighted
to hear this, and looked
forward to seeing the Monkey
do something wonderfully clever,
with his tail and his two hands
and two feet.</p>

<p>Morning came, and the rain
was over. The Monkey climbed
up into the tree, and in his rage
and envy he tore all the Crows'
nests to pieces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
Then the Crows were sorry they spoke, and determined<br />
for the future to mind their own business,<br />
and let fools alone. For, as the wise man<br />
said, "To give good advice to a fool<br />
is like pouring oil upon<br />
the fire."<br /><br />

<img src="images/i_188-a.png" width="118" height="175" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'> &nbsp;&nbsp;WILD Swan was flying once to his home, when
he paused to rest on a tree. This was a kind
of tree you have most likely never seen.
It was very tall, and had no branches upon
it until you came to the top, but at the
top was a large clump of green leaves, and
bunches of cocoa-nuts hanging down.</div>

<p>It so happened that on this tree was
the nest of a Paddy-bird. A Paddy-bird is a bird something
like a heron, which feeds on fish and frogs. At
the moment when the Swan perched upon the tree, this
Paddy-bird was sitting demurely on the edge of a pond
that was below the tree, watching the water for a rise.
She had no fishing-rod, but when she saw a little fish or
a frog swim past, out went her beak like a flash, and the
fish was pierced. Then she ate the fish, or carried it off
to her little ones in the nest.</p>

<p>When the Paddy-bird chanced to look round, she
saw the Swan sitting upon her tree. She was frightened
at this, thinking that perhaps it was some bird of prey,
come to devour her chicks. So she left her fishing, and
at once flew up to the top of the cocoa-nut tree. The
Swan looked harmless enough when she came closer, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
plucking up courage, the Paddy-bird thus addressed
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir. May I ask who you are?"</p>

<p>"I am a Swan," said the other, "and I am on my
way home; but as it is a hot day, I thought I would rest
awhile on your tree. I hope you have no objection?"</p>

<p>"Welcome, my lord Swan, welcome!" said the Paddy-bird.
"I only wish I could offer you entertainment.
But I am ashamed to say that I have no food worth
your taking. I am a poor bird, and you know we
Paddy-birds eat only small fish and frogs, which your
highness would hardly touch."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind for that," answered the Swan;
"thank you all the same, but I can find my own food
on this tree of yours."</p>

<p>This set our Paddy-bird's heart all a-flutter, for
what could he mean but her brood? However, all
was well in a minute; when she saw the Swan go to one
of the green cocoa-nuts hanging to the tree. You have
seen, I suppose, three little soft places at the top of a
cocoa-nut, which are holes in the shell filled up with
pulp. The Swan pierced his bill through one of these
holes, and drank the milk inside the cocoa-nut. Then
he gave some of the milk to the Paddy-bird, and flew
away.</p>

<p>This milk tasted very nice, and the Paddy-bird began
to say to herself, "What a fool I have been all these
years! Here am I, watching and waiting all day long
for a frog, and nasty things they are too, and all this
while there was plenty of delicious milk within a yard
of my nest! Well, good-bye fish, and good-bye frogs;
I have done with you now for ever."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The next time the Paddy-bird felt hungry, she flew
to a cocoa-nut and began to peck at it. But she did not
know the secret of the three little holes at the top of
the cocoa-nut; so she pecked, and pecked, and got no
further. At last she gathered all her strength, and gave
a tremendous peck at the cocoa-nut. Snap! her bill
broke off, and the blood ran out, and very soon the poor
Paddy-bird had bled to death.</p>

<div class='center'>
Next day, the Swan happened to fly by that way<br />
again; and coming to the tree, he found his friend the<br />
Paddy-bird lying dead on the ground, with her bill<br />
snapt off clean. He understood at once what had<br />
happened, and said to himself, "This is what<br />
comes of trying to do what one is not<br />
fit for. Let the cobbler stick to<br />
his last, or misfortune<br />
follows fast."<br /><br />

who had one cub. This cub did
not go to school, as you one day
will go; but he learned his lessons
at home. And what do you think
his lessons were? Not multiplication
which is vexation; not the
Rule of Three which puzzles me;
not spelling and copy-books. No; the Lioness had
only one lesson to teach her cub, and that was, to
avoid mankind as if they were poison. Every day,
morning and evening, she taught him for an hour;
telling him again and again, that of all the beasts of
the forest he need fear none, for a lion is stronger than
any, but man he must fear and keep clear of.</div>

<p>Well, the little Lion grew big; and as often happens
to children as well as lions' cubs, he grew conceited too.
He could not believe that his mother was old enough to
know better than he; no, he would see for himself. So
one fine day, this Lion set out on a voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>The first thing he saw was an Ox. This Ox was a
fine sturdy animal, and the Lion felt rather nervous to
see such hoofs and horns. You must remember he was
young and ignorant, and had hardly seen any animal but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
his mother and father. So he went up to the Ox, and
said timidly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir. Will you be good enough to
tell me if you are a Man?"</p>

<p>If an Ox could laugh, that Ox would have laughed
in the face of the Lion's cub. But an Ox is always
solemn, like a Turk, though he does not love bloodshed
as a Turk does. This Ox was chewing the cud,
munching and mouthing with great calmness, so as
to get the full flavour of the rich grass. He turned
his meek eyes, and stared at the Lion. Then he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"A Man! God forbid. A Man is a terrible creature.
He makes slaves of us Oxen, and puts a yoke on our
necks and fastens us to a thing called a plough; and
makes us pull the plough to and fro, up and down, till
we are tired to death. If we won't go, he sticks a prod
into us, which hurts us very much. I can't think what is
the use of all this pother; we get no good of it. And
when we are old, and can work no more, he kills us, and
eats our flesh, and the skin he makes into shoes for his
own feet. Keep clear of Men, if you value your life."
Then the Ox turned his head away, and went on with
his chewing.</p>

<p>This gave our Lion something to think about. He
thought the Ox a very fine animal indeed, and yet, said
the Ox, Man was stronger.</p>

<p>The Lion went his ways, and by-and-by, what should
he see but a Camel. If the Ox was a fine creature, here
was a finer; ever so tall, with a hump on his back, and a
long neck, and great long legs. Surely this must be the
terrible Man he had heard so much of. But to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
certain, he approached the Camel with great respect,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir. Pray, will you tell me if you
are a Man?"</p>

<p>The Camel turned his long neck, and sniffed and
sneered as Camels have a way of doing, and a most
unpleasant way it is.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said he. "Stuff! poof! you oaf! you think
me a Man? I wish I were a Man, wouldn't I make short
work of you! A man, quotha! Why, I am a slave to
that same Man. They catch us, these Men, and make
a hole in our noses, and put a ring in it&mdash;do you see my
ring? How do you think I like a hole made in my
nose, as if two holes were not enough! Then they tie
a rope to the ring, and lead us about all day long just
where they please, without a with your leave, or by your
leave! And they make us squat down in the mud,
and put a great load on our backs, enough to crush a
whipper-snapper like you. Groan as we may, it's all
of no use, they do what they choose. Man! the very
name makes me shiver. Get out, and leave me alone!"</p>

<p>This frightened our Lion, because who knew whether
the great animal might not kill him, if
it came into his head, so the Lion went
away as fast as he could.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 129px;">
<img src="images/i_193.png" width="129" height="125" alt="Elephant" title="" />
</div>

<p>In a little while, he espied an Elephant.
Here was a monster, to be sure! A great
black mountain, with a long nose curling
about, and huge white teeth sticking
out, and big ears flapping. The Lion was quite terrified
this time, and would not go near the Elephant, until he
suddenly saw that the Elephant had a rope round his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
tusks, by which he was tied fast to a stake. Then he
plucked up courage to approach, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good morning, my lord. Please will you tell me,
are you a Man?"</p>

<p>The Elephant trumpeted loudly. That was his way
of laughing at the idea that he could be mistaken for
a Man.</p>

<p>"Hooroo! hooroo!" he shrieked. "A Man! Hooroo!
No, but a Man is my master, and that's the truth.
A Man tied me to this post. Cruel and selfish brutes,
are men; and with all my strength, I am no match
for a Man. They get on our backs, a dozen of them
at a time, and make us fetch, and carry, and drive us
about by sticking a sharp spike into our skulls. Don't
you go near a Man, if you love your life; why, bless
me, they will make mincemeat of you! Hooroo!"
The Elephant swished his trunk all round him in his
excitement.</p>

<p>Our Lion had now seen three astonishing creatures,
and they all said that a Man was stronger than they
were. What could this terrible creature be like? He
must be a mountain indeed, if he was to master such
a beast as the black Elephant. Yet the black creature
said that Men got on his back, a dozen of them at
a time. The Lion could not understand it at all. He
shook his head, and stalked away thoughtful.</p>

<p>As the Lion was going along, he saw a puny and
weak-looking thing, walking upright on two legs. He
seemed to be a kind of monkey, thought the Lion. It
never entered his head that this little thing could be
a Man, but he trotted up to him gaily, and said&mdash;</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/i_195.png" width="252" height="500" alt="Man with ax and sheep" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Good morning, my friend. Can you tell me where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
I can find a Man? I have been hunting for one all
the morning."</p>

<p>"I am a Man," said the other.</p>

<p>At this the Lion laughed in his face. "You a
Man!" said he. "Come,
come; I may be young,
but I am no fool, my good
fellow. Why, you are not
so big as one leg of that
mountain over there, who
was tied to a stake, as he said,
by a Man."</p>

<p>"All the same," the Man said,
"I am one of them."</p>

<p>"But look here," the Lion
went on, "my father and mother
both say that Man is a terrible
and cruel creature, and the only
creature a Lion need fear. Now,
either you are no Man, or else
my father and mother are quite
wrong."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Man, "I am
not nearly so strong as you are,
or the Elephant and Camel, or
even the Ox. As you say, I am
not much to look at, but I have
one power which you all lack."</p>


<p>"Indeed," said the Lion, "and what may that be?"</p>

<p>The Man answered, "Reason."</p>

<p>"I never heard of reason," said the Lion. "Please
explain it to me, will you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not easy to explain what reason is," replied
the Man; "but if you like, I will show you how it
works."</p>

<p>The Lion was pleased. "Oh please do," he said.</p>

<p>I must tell you that this Man was a woodcutter,
and he had an axe upon his shoulder. He now lifted
this axe and drove a blow into a stout sapling which
grew hard by. When he had split the sapling, he
took a wedge of wood, and hammered it in with the
back of his axe, until there was a large cleft in the
trunk of the sapling. "Now then," said the Man, "just
put your paw in that hole."</p>

<p>The Lion obediently put his paw into the cleft, and
then the Man pulled out the wedge from the cleft.
The sapling closed tight on the paw of the Lion, and
squeezed it. "Now," said the Man, "you know what
reason is."</p>

<p>But the Lion no longer cared to hear about reason;
all he wanted was to get his paw out of the cleft. He
pulled and he tugged, he roared and he struggled;
but all of no use; he could not by any means get his
paw free. The end of all was, in madness and fury
he dashed his head against the ground, and died.</p>

<img src="images/i_197-t.png" width="205" height="275" alt="T" title="" />

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HERE was once a forest where a Lion
dwelt. Over all the beasts of the
forest the Lion lorded it, and of men
not one durst come near the place for
fear of King Lion; none, that is, except
one only, a Woodman who lived
in a little hut just upon the borders
of the woodland; and between
the forest and the hut a river flowed. This
Woodman came often into the forest, to cut
wood; and he had no fear to do so, because the Lion
and he were bosom friends. Such fast friends they were
that if ever the Woodman failed to pay his daily visit,
the Lion was grieved and missed him sorely.</div>

<p>It happened once that the Woodman fell ill of a
fever. In his woodland hut he lay all alone, for no wife
was there, or sister to care for him. So he tossed and
moaned, and waited for the hours to pass.</p>

<p>Of course during all this time the Woodman could
not visit the forest, and his friend the Lion missed him.
"What can be the matter," thought King Lion. "Has
some enemy killed him, or has he fallen sick?" At last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
he could no longer bear the suspense, and set out
in search of the Woodman.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Lion had ever yet been to
his friend's house; and for all he knew he might be
walking straight into a trap. But he was so fond of the
Woodman that he never thought of danger. All he
wanted was to see his friend. Accordingly, he followed
the path by which the Woodman came into the woods;
and in due time this path led him to the bank of a wide
and swift river, and over on the opposite bank was
a hut.</p>

<p>In plunged the Lion, not waiting to think; and
though there were crocodiles in that river ready to eat
him, and though the current bade fair to sweep him
away, so strong was his love for his friend that he swam
across.</p>

<p>The Woodman's house stood within an enclosure,
and all the doors and gates were shut; but the Lion
jumped over the wall, and searched about, until he
managed somehow to force his way into the house.
Then he saw his friend lying upon a bed, and very ill,
all alone, with no one to tend him.</p>

<p>How grieved the Lion was to see his friend, you can
imagine better than I can tell. The Lion knelt down
by his friend's side, and began to lick him all over.
This woke the man from his dazed condition; and when
he found the Lion licking his body, he did not like the
smell of the Lion, so he turned his head away, with a
grunt of disgust.</p>

<p>Now I think this was very unkind, because the Lion
had no other way of showing how much he cared for
his friend. Think what a long way he had come to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
his friend, and think what danger he had faced; and
now to be met with a grunt of disgust! The Lion
stopped licking the Woodman, and got up slowly, and
went away. Back he swam over the deep and swift
river, but all the heart was taken out of him; he cared
not for the crocodiles, indeed now he would not have
been very sorry if a crocodile had devoured him. One
crocodile did actually get a nip at his leg, and left a
wound there. Back to his den he crept, solitary and
sad. And when he got to his den, he lay down, sick
of his friend's fever, which he had taken by licking
him.</p>

<p>In a week or so, the Woodman was well again; and
thinking nothing of what had passed, he shouldered his
axe, and trudged away to cut wood. When the time
came for his midday meal, he went as his custom was
to the Lion's den; and there he found his friend the
Lion, thin and sick.</p>

<p>"Why, friend, what is the matter?" the Woodman
asked.</p>

<p>"I am ill," said the Lion.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the Woodman again.</p>

<p>But the Lion would answer nothing; and do what
he would, the man could not get him to say another
word. So he left him for that day, and went home.</p>

<p>For several days after, the man did the same thing;
and gradually the Lion got better. At last one day,
when the Lion was quite well again, the man said
to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me, good friend Lion, what it is that has made
you so silent and gloomy of late?"</p>

<p>Then answered the Lion, "O Woodman, I will tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
you. When you were ill, I swam a swift river and
faced death, all for your sake; I came into your house
when you lay deserted, and licked your body, and took
the fever which you had into my veins; and this wound
which you see, I received from a crocodile as I was
swimming across on my way back. But you received
me with scorn, and turned away your face in disgust.
The fever is gone, and this wound (as you see) is healed;
but the wound in my heart can never heal. You are no
true friend; and from henceforth our ways lie apart."</p>

<p>The man was ashamed of his unkindness, but it was
too late, for, as the poet says&mdash;</p>

<img src="images/i_058-o.png" width="154" height="155" alt="O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>NCE upon a time, a Cat and a
Parrot had joint lease of a certain
piece of land, which they tilled
together.</div>

<p>One day the Cat said to the
Parrot, "Come, friend, let us go
to the field."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "I can't come
now, because I am whetting my bill on the branch of
a mango-tree."</p>

<p>So the Cat went alone, and ploughed the field.
When the field was ploughed, the Cat came to the
Parrot again, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, friend, let us sow the corn."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "I can't come now, because I am
whetting my beak on the branch of a mango-tree."</p>

<p>So the Cat went alone, and sowed the corn. The
corn took root, the corn sprouted, it put forth the blade,
and the ear, and the ripe corn in the ear. Then again
the Cat came to the Parrot, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, friend, let us go and gather the harvest."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "I can't come now, because I am
whetting my beak on the branch of a mango-tree."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
<img src="images/i_202.png" width="409" height="600" alt="Cat and parrot" title="" />
</div>

<p>So the Cat went alone, and gathered the harvest.
She put it away in barns, and made ready for threshing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
When all was ready for the threshing, again the Cat
came to the Parrot, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, friend, let us thresh the corn."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "I can't come now, because I am
whetting my beak on the branch of a mango-tree."</p>

<p>So the Cat went, and threshed all the corn alone.
Then the Cat came back to the Parrot, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, friend, let us go and winnow the grain from
the chaff."</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, "I can't come now, because I am
whetting my beak on the branch of a mango-tree."</p>

<p>So the Cat winnowed the grain from the chaff alone.
Then she came back once again to the Parrot, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, friend, the grain is all winnowed and sifted;
come and divide it between us."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Parrot, and came at once. You
see the Cat had done all the work, but the Parrot was
quite ready to share the profit. They divided the corn
into two halves, and the Cat put her half away somewhere,
and the Parrot carried his half to his nest.</p>

<p>Then the Cat and the Parrot agreed to invite each
other to dinner every day; that is to say, the Cat asks
the Parrot to-day, and the Parrot asks the Cat to-morrow.
The Cat's turn came first. Then the Cat went to market
and bought a ha'porth of milk, a ha'porth of sugar,
and a ha'porth of rice. When the Parrot came there
was nothing but this stingy fare. Moreover, the Cat
was so inhospitable, that she actually made the Parrot
cook the food himself! Perhaps that was her way of
rebuking her friend for his laziness.</p>

<p>Next day the turn came to the Parrot. He procured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
about thirty pounds of flour, and plenty of butter, and
everything else that was needed, and cooked the food
before his guest came. He made enough cakes to fill
a washerwoman's basket&mdash;about five hundred.</p>

<p>When the Cat came, the Parrot put before her four
hundred and ninety-eight cakes, in a heap, and kept
back for himself only two. The Cat ate up the four
hundred and ninety-eight cakes in about three minutes,
and then asked for more.</p>

<p>The Parrot set before her the two cakes he had kept
for himself. The Cat devoured them, and then asked
for more.</p>

<p>The Parrot said, "I have no more cakes, but if you
are still hungry, you may eat me."</p>

<p>The Cat was still hungry, and ate the Parrot, bones
and beak and feathers. Thus the tables were turned;
for if the Parrot had the best of it before, the Cat had
the best of it now.</p>

<p>An old woman happened to be near, and saw this.
So she picked up a stone, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shoo! shoo! get away, or I'll kill you with this
stone."</p>

<p>Now the Cat thought to herself, "I ate a basketful
of cakes, I ate my friend the Parrot, and shall I blush
to eat this old hag?"</p>

<p>No, surely not. The Cat devoured the old Woman.</p>

<p>The Cat went along the road and perceived a Washerman
with a donkey. He said, "O Cat, get away, or my
donkey shall kick you to death!"</p>

<p>Thought the Cat, "I ate a basketful of cakes, I ate
my friend the Parrot, I ate the abusive old Woman, and
shall I blush to eat a Washerman?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>No, surely not. The Cat devoured the Washerman.</p>

<p>The Cat next met the wedding procession of a King:
a column of soldiers, and a row of fine elephants two
and two. The King said, "O Cat, get away, or my
elephants will trample you to death."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/i_206.png" width="307" height="400" alt="woman and cat" title="" />
</div>

<p>Thought the Cat, "I ate a basketful of cakes, I ate
my friend the Parrot, I ate the abusive old Woman, I ate
the Washerman and his donkey, and shall I blush to eat
a beggarly King?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>No, surely not. The Cat devoured the King, and his
procession, and his elephants too.</p>

<p>Then the Cat went on until she met a pair of
Landcrabs. "Run away, run away, Pussycat!" said
the Landcrabs, "or we will nip you!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the Cat, shaking her sides
(fat enough they were by this time), "I ate a basketful
of cakes, I ate my friend the Parrot, I ate an abusive
old Woman, I ate the Washerman and his donkey, I ate
the King and all his elephants, and shall I run away
from a Landcrab? Not so, but I will eat the Landcrab
too!" So saying, she pounced upon the Landcrabs.
Gobble, gobble, slip, slop: in two swallows the Landcrabs
went down the Cat's gullet.</p>

<p>But although the Landcrabs slid down the Cat's
gullet easily enough, you must know that they are hard
creatures, too hard for a Cat to bite; so they took
no harm at all. They found themselves amongst a
crowd of creatures. There was the King, sitting with
his head on his hands, very unhappy; there was the
King's newly-wed bride in a dead faint; there was a
company of soldiers, trying to form fours, but rather
muddled in mind; there was a herd of elephants,
trumpeting loudly; there was a donkey braying and the
Washerman beating the donkey with a stick; there was
the Parrot, whetting his beak on his own claws; then
there was the old Woman abusing them all roundly; and
last of all, five hundred cakes neatly piled in a corner.
The Landcrabs ran round to see what they could find;
and they found that the inside of the Cat was quite
soft. They could not see anything at all, except by
flashes, when the Cat opened her mouth, but they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
could feel. So they opened their claws, and nip!
nip! nip!</p>

<p>"Miaw!" squealed the Cat.</p>

<div class='center'>
Then came another nip, and another great Miaw!<br />
The Landcrabs went on nipping, until they had nipped<br />
a big round hole in the side of the Cat. By this time the<br />
Cat was lying down, in great pain; and as the hole was<br />
very big, out walked the Landcrabs, and scuttled away.<br />
Then out walked the King, carrying his bride; and out<br />
walked the elephants, two and two; out walked the<br />
soldiers, who had succeeded in forming fours-right, by<br />
your left, quick march! out walked the donkey, with<br />
the Washerman driving him along; out walked the old<br />
Woman, giving the Cat a piece of her mind; and last<br />
of all, out walked the Parrot, with a cake in each<br />
claw. Then they all went about their business,<br />
as if nothing had happened; and the<br />
Parrot flew back to whet his<br />
beak on the branch of the<br />
mango-tree.<br /><br />

it as the "Three Wishes," and Prior as "The Ladle." The

<p>In Oriental folk-lore the jackal takes the place which the fox

that the European Beast tales originated from the East (Tawney,
